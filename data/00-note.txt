---- NOTE ---------------------------------------
Please note that some of the datasets included in
this folder are pre-final versions that have not
been fully transformed into the Metapsy data
standard. Some of the variable names and coding may 
therefore differ in the released versions provided 
at to www.metapsy.org.

Databases have been prefiltered to fit the PICO
of the specific analysis.

The following databases are currently not included
but will be added here as soon as they are offi-
cially published (2023-11-13):

- prolonged grief disorder (`grief.csv`)
- social anxiety disorder (`sad.csv`)

As of now, running code chunks that rely on these
datasets will return an error. Until their offi-
cial release, these two datasets are available 
upon reasonable request 
(contact: mathias.harrer@tum.de).
