The primary outcome measurements concern was decline in consumption of psychiatric inpatient services and decline in Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI).METHODS: Eighty patients were randomized, either to the psychoeducative programme (consisting of eight sessions, each of 2?hours duration) and 2-year outpatient follow-up (42 cases), or only to 2-year outpatient follow-up (38 controls). The patients were monitored during 2 years after randomization. Data were collected from interviews including BDI, drug treatment and social measurements, and register data concerning use of psychiatric services.RESULTS: At 2-year follow-up, a significant reduction in the consumption of psychiatric inpatient services and in BDI was found; however, it was uniform for case and control patients. Drop-out/non-compliance was significantly more frequent among patients randomized to the control group. Furthermore, during follow-up the case group got a significant stronger attachment to the Labour market than the control group.CONCLUSIONS: The primary hypothesis could not be confirmed. Secondary outcome measurements concerning drop-out/non-compliance and attachment to the Labour market were significantly in favour of cases.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of psychoeducation is well documented in the treatment of relapse prevention of schizophrenia, and recently also in bipolar disorder; however, for recurrent depression only few controlled studies focusing on the efficacy of psychoeducation have been conducted.","The efficacy of psychoeducation on recurrent depression: a randomized trial with a 2-year follow-up","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/387/CN-01368387/frame.html and http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/08039488.2016.1266385?needAccess=true","Nordic journal of psychiatry","Aagaard, 2017","Aagaard_2017_msd_bdi-1_post_0_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

They were randomly assigned to either a group course condition, the Coping With Depression course, or an assessment-and-advice-only control group condition. Short-term results measured 1 month after completion of the course reveal that the course is effective in reducing depressive symptoms. The group course condition showed beneficial effects on depressive symptoms, pleasant activities, self-esteem, social skills, social support, and depressive thoughts. Changes in depressive cognition and self-esteem proved to be significant mediators of depressive symptoms. Possible implications for depression prevention are discussed.","The coping with depression course: Short-term outcomes and mediating effects of a randomized controlled trial in the treatment of subclinical depression","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L38821391 and http://elvis.ubvu.vu.nl:9003/vulink?sid=EMBASE&issn=00057894&id=doi:&atitle=The+coping+with+depression+course%3A+Short-term+outcomes+and+mediating+effects+of+a+randomized+controlled+trial+in+the+treatment+of+subclinical+depression&stitle=Behav.+Ther.&title=Behavior+Therapy&volume=34&issue=3&spage=381&epage=396&aulast=Allart-Van+Dam&aufirst=Esther&auinit=E.&aufull=Allart-Van+Dam+E.&coden=BHVTA&isbn=&pages=381-396&date=2003&auinit1=E&auinitm=","Behavior Therapy","Allart van Dam, 2003","AllartvanDam_2003_msd_bdi-1_post_0_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Objective: Short- and long-term efficacy of a cognitive-behavioral group program (CBT) was compared with a supportive group program (UGT), and a waiting list control condition. Methods: 51 depressed women in their menopause were randomized either to CBT, UGT or waiting list for 3 months of treatment. All interventions were delivered in a group setting, each session lasting 2 hours. Outcome was assessed post-treatment, after 6 months, and after 12 months. Assessment included self- and clinician ratings. Results: Both active interventions (CBT, UGT) were very well received by participating women (only 1 woman dropped out). They showed statistically and clinically significant improvement of depression and menopausal symptoms. Both treatments were superior to the control condition. These positive effects remained stable over 1 year of follow-up.

Journal of Clinical Psychiatry. 2012;73(1):66-73.","10.4088/JCP.11m06831","OBJECTIVE: To determine whether supportive-expressive psychotherapy (SET), a form of dynamic psychotherapy, and pharmacotherapy + clinical management (MED) for major depressive disorder (MDD) are more effective than pill-placebo + clinical management (PBO). METHOD: This National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored randomized controlled trial was conducted (from November 2001 through June 2007) at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. The sample included 156 patients diagnosed with MDD (DSM-IV) and having a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD(17)) score >/= 14 for at least 2 consecutive weeks. This was an underserved sample in which 41% were male, 52% were self-designated minorities, and 76% had an annual income under $30,000. Treatment lasted 16 weeks. Medication patients not responsive by week 8 (maximum dose 200 mg/d of sertraline) were switched to venlafaxine (maximum dose 375 mg/d). Nonresponsive placebo patients at week 8 were switched to a different placebo. RESULTS: Patients' depression improved over the 16 weeks (P < .0001), with no between-group differences (P = .95), even among severely (HRSD(17) score >/= 20) depressed patients (P = .45). Response rates did not differ between groups (P = .73). Gender and minority status moderated outcome (P = .014), with psychotherapy more efficacious for minority men than MED (P = .027, Cohen d = 1.02) and PBO (P = .019, d = 1.09). PBO was more efficacious for white men than MED (P = .03, d = 0.62) and SET (P = .003, d = 1.07). For white women, MED (P = .005, d = 0.77) and SET (P = .033, d = 0.71) were more efficacious than placebo. No differences among treatments were found for minority women.

METHOD: This National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)-sponsored randomized controlled trial was conducted (from November 2001 through June 2007) at the University of Pennsylvania Medical School. The sample included 156 patients diagnosed with MDD (DSM-IV) and having a 17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD(17)) score >/= 14 for at least 2 consecutive weeks. This was an underserved sample in which 41% were male, 52% were self-designated minorities, and 76% had an annual income under $30,000. Treatment lasted 16 weeks. Medication patients not responsive by week 8 (maximum dose 200 mg/d of sertraline) were switched to venlafaxine (maximum dose 375 mg/d). Nonresponsive placebo patients at week 8 were switched to a different placebo. RESULTS: Patients' depression improved over the 16 weeks (P < .0001), with no between-group differences (P = .95), even among severely (HRSD(17) score >/= 20) depressed patients (P = .45). Response rates did not differ between groups (P = .73). Gender and minority status moderated outcome (P = .014), with psychotherapy more efficacious for minority men than MED (P = .027, Cohen d = 1.02) and PBO (P = .019, d = 1.09). PBO was more efficacious for white men than MED (P = .03, d = 0.62) and SET (P = .003, d = 1.07). For white women, MED (P = .005, d = 0.77) and SET (P = .033, d = 0.71) were more efficacious than placebo. No differences among treatments were found for minority women. CONCLUSIONS: This trial of urban MDD patients failed to confirm that either active treatment was better than placebo. Minority status and gender had significant and differential effects on outcome that warrant replication in future studies.

Paroxetine (n=80) or placebo (n=81) therapy was started at 10 mg per day and increased to a maximum 40 mg per day, or PST-PC was provided (n=80). There were 6 scheduled visits for all treatment conditions. POPULATION We included a total of 241 primary care patients with minor depression (n=114) or dysthymia (n=127). Of these, 191 patients (79.3%) completed all treatment visits. OUTCOMES We measured depressive symptoms using the 20-item Hopkins Depression Scale (HSCL-D-20).

Results from meta-analyses suggest that guidance is important and that self-help programs without support are less effective. However, there are no direct experimental comparisons between guided and unguided internet-based treatments for depression. The present study compared the benefits of a 10-week web-based unguided self-help treatment with the same intervention complemented with weekly therapist support via e-mail. A waiting-list control group was also included. Seventy-six individuals meeting the diagnostic criteria of major depression or dysthymia were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) was used as the primary outcome measure. Secondary outcomes included general psychopathology, interpersonal problems, and quality of life. Sixty-nine participants (91%) completed the assessment at posttreatment and 59 (78%) at 6-month follow-up. Results showed significant symptom reductions in both treatment groups compared to the waiting-list control group. At posttreatment, between-group effect sizes on the BDI-II were d = .66 for unguided self-help versus waiting-list and d = 1.14 for guided self-help versus waiting-list controls. In the comparison of the two active treatments, small-to-moderate, but not statistically significant effects in favor of the guided condition were found on all measured dimensions. In both groups, treatment gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. The findings provide evidence that internet-delivered treatments for depression can be effective whether support is added or not. However, all participants were interviewed in a structured diagnostic telephone interview before inclusion, which prohibits conclusions regarding unguided treatments that are without any human contact.","Internet-based treatment of depression: a randomized controlled trial comparing guided with unguided self-help","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/193/CN-00851193/frame.html and http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/16506073.2011.616531","Cognitive behaviour therapy","Berger, 2011","Berger_2011_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_cbt_wl_cbt(guidedi-cbt)_wl","A - Western"

The purpose of this trial was to determine the efficacy of short-term psychodynamic psychotherapy (STPP) in non-metastatic breast cancer patients diagnosed with depression, one of the most frequent mental comorbidities of breast cancer. Patients and methods: In a multicenter prospective trial, 157 breast cancer patients with comorbid depression were randomized to either individual STPP (intervention group, N = 78) or 'treatment as usual' (control group, TAU, N = 79). As our primary outcome measure, we hypothesized a higher rate of remission defined as no diagnosis of depression (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV) and reduction in depression score by at least 2 points (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, HADS-D) in STPP versus TAU at treatment termination. Secondary outcomes mainly refer to quality of life (QoL). Results: In the intention to treat (ITT) analysis, 44% of the STPP group achieved highly significantly more remission than TAU (23%). STPP treatment (OR = 7.64; P < 0.001) was the strongest predictor for remission post-treatment; time was also significant (OR = 0.96; P < 0.05). A high effect favoring STPP (d = 0.82) was observed for the HADS-D score posttreatment (secondary outcome). Regarding further secondary outcomes (QoL), analyses of covariance yielded main effects for group (favoring STPP with an effect size of at least d = 0.5) for global QoL, role, emotional and social functioning, pain, treatment side-effects, breast symptoms and upset by hair loss. Conclusions: STPP is an effective treatment of a broad range of depressive conditions in breast cancer patients improving depression and functional QoL. Findings are limited by the drop-out rate (~1/3) and delayed post-treatment assessments. Future trials may consider stepped-care approaches, tailored to patients' needs and requirements in the acute treatment phase. The Author 2013.

The ACT intervention is aimed at increasing the acceptance of negative thoughts and emotions and living a mindful and value-based life. METHOD: Adults with mild to moderate depressive symptomatology were randomly assigned to the ACT intervention (n=49) or to a waiting list (n=44). The mean age of the participants was 49 years. The majority of the participants was female and of Dutch origin. All the participants completed measures before and after the intervention, as well as three months later at follow-up to assess depression (CES-D), anxiety (HADS-A), fatigue (CIS), alcohol use and acceptance (AAQ-II). RESULTS: The ACT intervention led to statistically significant reduction in depressive symptomatology (Cohen's d=.60). These reductions were maintained at the three-month follow-up. Also significant reductions in anxiety and fatigue were observed. Moreover, mediational analysis showed that the improvement of acceptance during the intervention mediated the effects of the intervention on depressive symptomatology at follow-up. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that an early intervention based on ACT, aimed at increasing acceptance, is effective in reducing depressive symptomatology.","Efficacy of an early intervention based on acceptance and commitment therapy for adults with depressive symptomatology: Evaluation in a randomized controlled trial","http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0005796710002202/1-s2.0-S0005796710002202-main.pdf?_tid=89318204-d477-11e4-9a21-00000aacb35d&acdnat=1427457239_8ee32b941eb20b93df338735ddc0bdfd and http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0005796710002202/1-s2.0-S0005796710002202-main.pdf?_tid=971a462e-5868-11e5-8935-00000aab0f6c&acdnat=1441964374_e8fec43d086a58085d383211216c5445","Behav Res Ther","Bohlmeijer, 2011","Bohlmeijer_2011_msd_ces-d_post_0_self-report_3rd_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

OBJECTIVES: To test the efficacy of group interpersonal psychotherapy in alleviating depression and dysfunction and to evaluate the feasibility of conducting controlled trials in Africa. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: For this cluster randomized, controlled clinical trial (February-June 2002), 30 villages in the Masaka and Rakai districts of rural Uganda were selected using a random procedure; 15 were then randomly assigned for studying men and 15 for women. In each village, adult men or women believed by themselves and other villagers to have depressionlike illness were interviewed using a locally adapted Hopkins Symptom Checklist and an instrument assessing function. Based on these interviews, lists were created for each village totaling 341 men and women who met Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) criteria for major depression or subsyndromal depression. Interviewers revisited them in order of decreasing symptom severity until they had 8 to 12 persons per village, totaling 284. Of these, 248 agreed to be in the trial and 9 refused; the remainder died or relocated. A total of 108 men and 116 women completed the study and were reinterviewed. INTERVENTION: Eight of the 15 male villages and 7 of the 15 female villages were randomly assigned to the intervention arm and the remainder to the control arm. The intervention villages received group interpersonal psychotherapy for depression as weekly 90-minute sessions for 16 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depression and dysfunction severity scores on scales adapted and validated for local use; proportion of persons meeting DSM-IV major depression diagnostic criteria. RESULTS: Mean reduction in depression severity was 17.47 points for intervention groups and 3.55 points for controls (P<.001). Mean reduction in dysfunction was 8.08 and 3.76 points, respectively (P<.001). After intervention, 6.5% and 54.7% of the intervention and control groups, respectively, met the criteria for major depression (P<.001) compared with 86% and 94%, respectively, prior to intervention (P =.04). The odds of postintervention depression among controls was 17.31 (95% confidence interval, 7.63-39.27) compared with the odds among intervention groups. Results from intention-to-treat analyses remained statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Group interpersonal psychotherapy was highly efficacious in reducing depression and dysfunction. A clinical trial proved feasible in the local setting. Both findings should encourage similar trials in similar settings in Africa and beyond.","Group interpersonal psychotherapy for depression in rural Uganda: a randomized controlled trial","http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/4884/JOC30288.pdf","Jama","Bolton, 2003","Bolton_2003_msd_hscl-d_post_0_clinician_ipt_cau_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

BMC psychiatry. 2013;13:33.","10.1186/1471-244x-13-33","BACKGROUND: Few trials have evaluated the effectiveness of psychological treatment in improving depression by the end of pregnancy. This is the first pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) looking at treating depression by the end of pregnancy. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of delivering a CBT intervention modified for antenatal depression during pregnancy. METHODS: Women in North Bristol, UK between 8-18 weeks pregnant were recruited through routine contact with midwives and randomised to receive up to 12 sessions of individual CBT in addition to usual care or to continue with usual care only. Women were eligible for randomisation if they screened positive on a 3-question depression screen used routinely by midwives and met ICD-10 criteria for depression assessed using the clinical interview schedule - revised version (CIS-R). Two CBT therapists delivered the intervention. Follow-up was at 15 and 33 weeks post-randomisation when assessments of mental health were made using measures which included the CIS-R. RESULTS: Of the 50 women assessed for the trial, 36 met ICD-10 depression criteria and were randomised: 18 to the intervention and 18 to usual care. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) women who were allocated to receive the intervention completed 9 or more sessions of CBT before the end of pregnancy. Follow-up rates at 15 and 33 weeks post-randomisation were higher in the group who received the intervention (89% vs. 72% at 15 weeks and 89% vs. 61% at 33 weeks post-randomisation). At 15 weeks post-randomisation (the end of pregnancy), there were more women in the intervention group (11/16; 68.7%) who recovered (i.e. no longer met ICD-10 criteria for depression), than those receiving only usual care (5/13; 38.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial shows the feasibility of conducting a large RCT to assess the effectiveness of CBT for treating antenatal depression before the end of pregnancy. The intervention could be delivered during the antenatal period and there was some evidence to suggest that it could be effective.

This is the first pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) of individual cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) looking at treating depression by the end of pregnancy. Our aim was to assess the feasibility of delivering a CBT intervention modified for antenatal depression during pregnancy. METHODS: Women in North Bristol, UK between 8-18 weeks pregnant were recruited through routine contact with midwives and randomised to receive up to 12 sessions of individual CBT in addition to usual care or to continue with usual care only. Women were eligible for randomisation if they screened positive on a 3-question depression screen used routinely by midwives and met ICD-10 criteria for depression assessed using the clinical interview schedule - revised version (CIS-R). Two CBT therapists delivered the intervention. Follow-up was at 15 and 33 weeks post-randomisation when assessments of mental health were made using measures which included the CIS-R. RESULTS: Of the 50 women assessed for the trial, 36 met ICD-10 depression criteria and were randomised: 18 to the intervention and 18 to usual care. Thirteen of the 18 (72%) women who were allocated to receive the intervention completed 9 or more sessions of CBT before the end of pregnancy. Follow-up rates at 15 and 33 weeks post-randomisation were higher in the group who received the intervention (89% vs. 72% at 15 weeks and 89% vs. 61% at 33 weeks post-randomisation). At 15 weeks post-randomisation (the end of pregnancy), there were more women in the intervention group (11/16; 68.7%) who recovered (i.e. no longer met ICD-10 criteria for depression), than those receiving only usual care (5/13; 38.5%). CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial shows the feasibility of conducting a large RCT to assess the effectiveness of CBT for treating antenatal depression before the end of pregnancy. The intervention could be delivered during the antenatal period and there was some evidence to suggest that it could be effective.

There were two main significant (p<.01) findings.

Second, the overall average service use cost per case in the SYTL group was significantly lower than that of the TAU group (726 vs.1187). This was largely due to the lower cost of the SYTL group therapy program compared with TAU which involved individual therapy. The pattern of results in an intention-to-treat analysis was similar to that in the completer analysis, though group difference did not reach significance due to inadequate statistical power and conservative missing data imputation procedures.

The current interim report is based on data from the first 82 cases recruited into the trial. There were 57 trial completers at post-treatment. At pretreatment on demographic and clinical variables, there were no significant differences between trial completers and dropouts in SYTL and TAU groups. There were two main significant (p<.01) findings. Compared with TAU treatment-completers, more than twice as many SYTL treatment-completers (28 vs. 72%) were recovered 3months after therapy using stringent recovery criteria (no longer meeting DSM-5 diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and scoring below clinical cut-off scores on the Beck Depression Inventory II, the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, and the MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale and showing reliable change on these three measures of depressive symptom severity). Second, the overall average service use cost per case in the SYTL group was significantly lower than that of the TAU group (726 vs.1187). This was largely due to the lower cost of the SYTL group therapy program compared with TAU which involved individual therapy. The pattern of results in an intention-to-treat analysis was similar to that in the completer analysis, though group difference did not reach significance due to inadequate statistical power and conservative missing data imputation procedures.

Methods: Six month-controlled trial of patients who were referred to randomly assigned GPs (four for experimental group of patients and ten for the control) was done. Experimental sample had 34 patients with DSM-IV diagnosis of Depression (Depressed Episode, Dysthymia, or Adjustment Disorder with Depressed Mood) receiving the TAU supplemented with counseling. Control group had 30 patients with diagnosis of Depression receiving only the TAU. Results: The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) score improved in both groups. Patients in the experimental group showed greater improvement compared to the control group at T2. The World Health Organization Quality OF Life Questionnaire (WHOQOL) score also improved in the experimental group but not in the control group. The improvement in the experimental group was statistically significant in terms of both BDI and WHOQOL scores. Conclusions: Adding counseling to TAU in general medical practice settings is more effective in controlling the symptoms of depression and improving the quality of life as measured over a period of six months, than TAU alone. These results while encouraging, also calls for a larger study involving a largersample size and a longer period of time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2014 APA, all rights reserved).

METHODS: In a randomized, controlled trial, 246 participants over 20 years old with ICD-10 major depression were recruited through nurses/general practitioners at 12 urban Primary Care Centers (PCCs) in Barcelona. The intervention group (IG) (n=119) received a group psychoeducational program (12 weekly, 1.5 h sessions led by two nurses) and the control group (CG) (n=112) received usual care. Patients were assessed at baseline and at, 3, 6 and 9 months. The main outcome measures were the BDI, EQ-5D and remission based upon the BDI. RESULTS: 231 randomized patients were included, of whom 85 had mild depression and 146 moderate depression. The analyses showed significant differences between groups in relation to remission of symptoms, especially in the mild depression group with a high rate of 57% (p=0.009) at post-treatment and 65% (p=0.006) at 9 month follow up, and only showed significant differences on the BDI at post-treatment (p=0.016; effect size Cohen's d'=.51) and at 6 and 9 month follow-up (p= 0.048; d'=.44).In the overall and moderate sample, the analyses only showed significant differences between groups on the BDI at post-treatment, p=0.02 (d'=.29) and p=0.010 (d'=.47), respectively.The psychoeducation group improved significantly on the EQ-5D at short and long-term. CONCLUSIONS: This psychoeducational intervention is a short and long-term effective treatment for patients with mild depression symptoms.

METHODS: Seventy-five participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder were randomly assigned to receive either 10-session CBT or DMBI, or placed on a waitlist. Pre-post measurements included record of anti-depressants treatment, ratings by psychiatrists who were blinded to the experimental design and self-report on mood measures, and performance in a cognitive test tapping concentration ability. RESULTS: Both the CBT and DMBI groups demonstrated significantly reduced overall depressive syndrome after intervention at large effect size (0.93-1.10). Furthermore, the DMBI group (p<0.05), but not the CBT or waitlist groups, demonstrated significant reduction in intake of anti-depressants, and significant improvement in specific depression-related symptoms including difficulty in concentration (p=0.002), and problems in gastrointestinal health (p=0.02) and overall sleep quality (p<0.001). LIMITATIONS: This study has provided some evidence for the short-term effect of the DMBI on Chinese population.

The study aimed to examine the effects of the life storybook creation process on depressive symptoms among older community-dwelling Chinese adults in Singapore. A randomised controlled trial was conducted from January 2011 to March 2012. Twenty-six Chinese aged over 60 years, who were able to communicate in Chinese and/or English, and with mild to severe depression were randomly allocated to either the life storybook (intervention) group (n = 14) or the non-life storybook (control) group (n = 12). Subjects in the intervention group were interviewed on a one to one basis on five sessions over 8 weeks. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Geriatric Depression Scale. Generalised estimating equations were used to examine the effects of the intervention on the elderly peoples' depression level. Significant reductions in depression scores were found in the intervention group from baseline (mean 7.9 [SD 3.0]) to week 8 (2.5 [1.7], chi(2) = 15.25, P < 0.001). At week 8, the intervention group showed a lower level of depression than the control (chi(2) = 4.33, P = 0.037). This study supports the life storybook creation process as an effective intervention for depressed older Chinese adults living in the community. The findings suggest that this intervention may enhance the quality of care provided by healthcare providers as the therapeutic relationship between provider and client is being established.","A randomised controlled study to explore the effect of life story review on depression in older Chinese in Singapore","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/hsc.12043/asset/hsc12043.pdf?v=1&t=i84tg8y7&s=b7cc8f38c6b8500dd6a36a4cbe22f466e9ab24e3 and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/hsc.12043/asset/hsc12043.pdf?v=1&t=iefgrftp&s=20a15a5a42e2707cb1579030d7cfb36e0b321bea","Health Soc Care Community","Chan, 2013","Chan_2013_msd_gds_post_0_self-report_lrt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

In this randomized controlled study, we systematically evaluated the effects of weekly supportive group meetings for women with postnatal distress. METHODS: Sixty postnatally distressed women were randomly assigned to support (n=30) and control (n=30) groups. Women assigned to the support group participated in four supportive group sessions that comprised discussions concerning transition to motherhood, postnatal stress management, communication skills, and life planning. RESULTS: Subjects who attended the support sessions had significantly decreased scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS), and significantly increased scores on the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL) as evaluated at the end of the fourth weekly session. In contrast, no significant changes were observed in the control group during this period.

This was a single-blind randomized controlled study with a 2-arm parallel group design. Eighty-one subjects were randomly assigned to 12 sessions intervention group (CBGT) or control group (usual outpatient psychiatric care group) and 62 completed the study. The primary outcome was depression measured with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The secondary outcomes were automatic thoughts measured by automatic thoughts questionnaire (ATQ). Both groups were evaluated at the pretest (before 2 weeks), posttest (after 12 therapy sessions), and short- (3 months), medium- (6 months), and long-term (12 months) follow-up.

This was a single-blind randomized controlled study with a 2-arm parallel group design. Eighty-one subjects were randomly assigned to 12 sessions intervention group (CBGT) or control group (usual outpatient psychiatric care group) and 62 completed the study. The primary outcome was depression measured with Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD). The secondary outcomes were automatic thoughts measured by automatic thoughts questionnaire (ATQ). Both groups were evaluated at the pretest (before 2 weeks), posttest (after 12 therapy sessions), and short- (3 months), medium- (6 months), and long-term (12 months) follow-up. After receiving CBGT, the experimental group had a statistically significant reduction in the BDI-II from 40.30 at baseline to 17.82 points at session eight and to 10.17 points at postintervention (P < 0.001).

Methods: A total of 121 homebound individuals who were age 50+ and scored 15+ on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) participated in the three-arm randomized control trial, comparing tele-PST with in-person PST and telephone support calls. Six sessions of the PST-primary care were conducted for the PST participants. For tele-PST, sessions 2e6 were conducted via Skype video call. Acceptance of tele-PST or in-person PST was measured with the 11-item, 7-point scale modified Treatment Evaluation Inventory (TEI). A mixed-effect regression analysis was used to examine the effects of treatment group, time, and the interaction term between treatment group and time on the HAMD scores. Results: The TEI score was slightly higher among tele-PST participants than among in-person PST participants. The HAMD scores of tele-PST participants and in-person PST participants at a 12-week follow-up were significantly lower than those of telephone support call participants, and the treatment effects were maintained at a 24-week follow-up. The HAMD scores of tele-PST participants did not differ from those of in-person PST participants. Conclusions: Despite their initial skepticism, almost all participants had extremely positive attitudes toward tele-PST at the 12-week followup. Tele-PST also appears to be an efficacious treatment modality for depressed homebound older adults and to have significant potential to facilitate their access to treatment.

Methods: A total of 121 homebound individuals who were age 50+ and scored 15+ on the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) participated in the three-arm randomized control trial, comparing tele-PST with in-person PST and telephone support calls. Six sessions of the PST-primary care were conducted for the PST participants. For tele-PST, sessions 2e6 were conducted via Skype video call. Acceptance of tele-PST or in-person PST was measured with the 11-item, 7-point scale modified Treatment Evaluation Inventory (TEI). A mixed-effect regression analysis was used to examine the effects of treatment group, time, and the interaction term between treatment group and time on the HAMD scores. Results: The TEI score was slightly higher among tele-PST participants than among in-person PST participants. The HAMD scores of tele-PST participants and in-person PST participants at a 12-week follow-up were significantly lower than those of telephone support call participants, and the treatment effects were maintained at a 24-week follow-up. The HAMD scores of tele-PST participants did not differ from those of in-person PST participants. Conclusions: Despite their initial skepticism, almost all participants had extremely positive attitudes toward tele-PST at the 12-week followup. Tele-PST also appears to be an efficacious treatment modality for depressed homebound older adults and to have significant potential to facilitate their access to treatment.

Objective  To evaluate clinical effectiveness of a brief, aging serviceâintegrated, videoconferenced behavioral activation (tele-BA) treatment delivered by lay counselors compared with videoconferenced problem-solving therapy (tele-PST) delivered by licensed clinicians and attention control (AC; telephone support calls).





Design, Setting, and Participants  This 3-group randomized clinical trial using a randomization prior to consent approach included individuals aged 50 years or older who were homebound and had 24-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) scores of 15 or greater between February 15, 2016, and April 15, 2019. Tele-BA and tele-PST participants received 5 weekly treatment sessions. Assessments were performed at baseline and 12, 24, and 36 weeks after baseline. Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020.





Interventions  Tele-BA participants were taught 5 steps for reinforcing healthy behaviors to improve mood, physical functioning, and social engagement. Tele-PST participants were taught a 7-step approach for problem solving coping skills.





Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was the 24-item HAMD scores. Response (ie, â¥50% reduction in HAMD) and remission (ie, HAMD <10) rates and effect sizes for clinically meaningful differences were examined. Secondary outcomes were disability, social engagement and activity frequency, and satisfaction with participation in social roles.





Results  A total of 277 participants were enrolled, including 193 (69.7%) women, 83 (30.0%) who were Black, 81 (29.2%) who were Hispanic, and 255 (92.1%) with income of $35â¯000 or less. The mean (SD) age was 67.5 (8.9) years. Among these, 90 participants were randomized to tele-BA, 93 participants were randomized to tele-PST, and 94 participants were randomized to the AC.

Intention-to-treat statistical analyses were performed from January 1, 2020, to February 15, 2020.





Interventions  Tele-BA participants were taught 5 steps for reinforcing healthy behaviors to improve mood, physical functioning, and social engagement. Tele-PST participants were taught a 7-step approach for problem solving coping skills.





Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary outcome was the 24-item HAMD scores. Response (ie, â¥50% reduction in HAMD) and remission (ie, HAMD <10) rates and effect sizes for clinically meaningful differences were examined. Secondary outcomes were disability, social engagement and activity frequency, and satisfaction with participation in social roles.





Results  A total of 277 participants were enrolled, including 193 (69.7%) women, 83 (30.0%) who were Black, 81 (29.2%) who were Hispanic, and 255 (92.1%) with income of $35â¯000 or less. The mean (SD) age was 67.5 (8.9) years. Among these, 90 participants were randomized to tele-BA, 93 participants were randomized to tele-PST, and 94 participants were randomized to the AC. Compared with participants in the AC group, participants in the tele-BA and tele-PST groups had significantly higher response and remission rates and medium to large effect sizes (tele-BA: raw growth modeling analysis dâ=â0.62 [95% CI, 0.35 to 0.89]; Pâ<â.001; tele-PST: raw growth modeling analysis dâ=â1.00 [95% CI, 0.73 to 1.26]; Pâ<â.001) for HAMD scores. While tele-PST was significantly more effective than tele-BA for reducing HAMD scores (t258â=ââ2.79; Pâ=â.006), there was no difference between tele-BA and tele-PST on secondary outcomes.





Conclusions and Relevance  In this randomized clinical trial, participants who received tele-BA by lay counselors achieved statistically and clinically meaningful changes in depressive symptoms. Given shortages of licensed mental health clinicians, tele- and lay counselorâdelivered services may help improve access to evidence-based depression treatment for large numbers of underserved older adults.",NA,NA,NA,"Choi, 2020b","Choi_2020b_msd_hdrs-24_post_24_clinician_bat_otherctr_bat(bat(videoconflaycounselors))_otherctr","A - Western"

They were assessed immediately after the treatment phase (at 4.5 months) and at 9, 18 and 60 months post-partum. RESULTS: Compared with the control, all three treatments had a significant impact at 4.5 months on maternal mood (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, EPDS). Only psychodynamic therapy produced a rate of reduction in depression (Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-III - R) significantly superior to that of the control. The benefit of treatment was no longer apparent by 9 months post-partum. Treatment did not reduce subsequent episodes of post-partum depression. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological intervention for post-partum depression improves maternal mood (EPDS) in the short term. However, this benefit is not superior to spontaneous remission in the long term.","Controlled trial of the short- and long-term effect of psychological treatment of post-partum depression. I.

Neuropathic pain is a complicated phenomenon in patients with diabetes. These patients have many problems, especially depression and Sleep disturbance. This study aimed to assess the effectiveness of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy on depression and Sleep disturbance in patients with painful diabetic neuropathy.





Methods


The current paper was conducted according to the clinical trial method with 50 participants. Participants were separated into intervention and control groups randomly. Based on the diagnosis of neurologists, all participants received standard medications to regulate neuropathic pain. The intervention group received ACT for eight sessions. The results were evaluated in the pre-test, post-test, and follow-up. The tools used were the Pittsburgh sleep quality index (PSQI) and Beckâs depression inventory. Statistical analysis includes descriptive statistics, and repeated-measures (ANOVA) conducted by SPSS (version 26) software. Results: Results showed that in the intervention group, the treatment led to improved depressive symptoms (Fâ=â6.81, Pâ<â0.05). Besides, for sleep quality, treatment in all subscales, except for the Hypnotic medicine subscale, significantly improved the intervention groupâs situations. It was also observed that the overall quality of sleep in the ACT group showed a more significant improvement (Pâ<â0.05). All the above results remained the same until the end of the follow-up period (Pâ<â0.05).





Conclusion


ACT, as a complementary treatment, can improve the psychiatric symptoms and problems in people with neuropathic pain. Therefore, it is necessary to include psychotherapy services along with medical treatment in outpatient and hospitalization units.",NA,NA,NA,"Davoudi, 2020","Davoudi_2020_msd_bdi-1_post_8_self-report_3rd_otherctr_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

Program ACTIVE II was a randomized, controlled, multicenter treatment trial designed to test the comparative effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and/or community-based exercise (EXER) on diabetes and depression outcomes compared with usual care (UC). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Using a 22 factorial randomized controlled trial design, adults with T2DM for 1 year who met DSM-IV-TR criteria for MDD were randomized to CBT (10 sessions occurring over 12 weeks; N = 36), EXER (12 weeks of community-based exercise including six sessions with a personal trainer; N = 34), CBT+EXER (concurrent over a 12-week period; N = 34), and UC (N = 36). Primary outcomes were depression remission rate (assessed by psychiatric interviewers blind to assignment) and change in glycemic control (HbA1c). RESULTS Themean age was 56.0 years (SD 10.7). Participants were female (77%), white (71%), and married (52%). After controlling for education and antidepressant use, odds of achieving full MDD remission in the intervention groups were 5.0-6.8 times greater than UC (P < 0.0167). The CBT+EXER group demonstrated improved HbA1c compared with UC. For participants with a baseline HbA1c 7.0%, exploratory post hoc subgroup analysis showed that the CBT+EXER group had a 1.1% improvement in HbA1c (P < 0.0001) after controlling for covariates.

We tested the effects of a brief cognitive therapy intervention on depressive symptoms, negative thinking, health-related quality of life, and cardiac event-free survival. METHODS AND RESULTS: Hospitalized patients with depressive symptoms (n = 41, 66 +/- 11 years, 45% female, 81% New York Heart Association Class III/IV) were randomly assigned to control group or a brief, nurse-delivered cognitive therapy intervention, delivered during hospitalization and followed by a 1-week booster phone call. Depressive symptoms, negative thinking, and health-related quality of life were measured at 1 week and 3 months. Cardiac event-free survival was assessed at 3 months. Mixed models repeated measures analysis of variance, Kaplan-Meier, and Cox regression were used for data analysis. There were significant improvements in depressive symptoms and health-related quality of life in both groups but no interactions between group and time. The control group had shorter 3-month cardiac event-free survival (40% versus 80%, P < .05) and a 3.5 greater hazard of experiencing a cardiac event (P = .04) than the intervention group. CONCLUSION: Nurses can deliver a brief intervention to hospitalized patients with heart failure that may improve short-term, event-free survival.

Postpartum depression and anxiety are under-addressed public health problems with numerous treatment access barriers, including insufficiently available mental health specialist providers.





Aims


To examine the effectiveness of nurse-delivered telephone interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) for postpartum depression. Trial registration ISRCTN88987377.





Method


Postpartum women (n = 241) with major depression (on the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-I)) from 36 Canadian public health regions in rural and urban settings were randomly assigned to 12 weekly 60 min nurse-delivered telephone-IPT sessions or standard locally available care. The primary outcome was the proportion of women clinically depressed at 12 weeks post-randomisation, with masked intention-to-treat analysis. Secondary outcomes examined included comorbid anxiety, self-reported attachment and partner relationship quality.





Results


At 12 weeks, 10.6% of women in the IPT group (11/104) and 35% in the control group (35/100) remained depressed (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.10â0.46), with the IPT group 4.5 times less likely to be clinically depressed (SCID); 21.2% in the IPT group and 51% in the control group had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score >12 (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.14â0.48), and attachment avoidance decreased more in the IPT group than in the control group (P = 0.02). Significant differences favoured the IPT group for comorbid anxiety and partner relationship quality at all time points, with no differences in health service or antidepressant use. None of the IPT responders relapsed by 36 weeks. Between-group SCID differences were sustained at 24 weeks, but not at 36 weeks.

Nurse-delivered telephone IPT is an effective treatment for diverse urban and rural women with postpartum depression and anxiety that can improve treatment access disparities.",NA,NA,NA,"Dennis, 2020","Dennis_2020_msd_epds_post_12_self-report_ipt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

At 12 weeks, 10.6% of women in the IPT group (11/104) and 35% in the control group (35/100) remained depressed (OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.10â0.46), with the IPT group 4.5 times less likely to be clinically depressed (SCID); 21.2% in the IPT group and 51% in the control group had an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score >12 (OR = 0.26, 95% CI 0.14â0.48), and attachment avoidance decreased more in the IPT group than in the control group (P = 0.02). Significant differences favoured the IPT group for comorbid anxiety and partner relationship quality at all time points, with no differences in health service or antidepressant use. None of the IPT responders relapsed by 36 weeks. Between-group SCID differences were sustained at 24 weeks, but not at 36 weeks.





Conclusions


Nurse-delivered telephone IPT is an effective treatment for diverse urban and rural women with postpartum depression and anxiety that can improve treatment access disparities.",NA,NA,NA,"Dennis, 2020","Dennis_2020_remission(diag)_scid_post_12_self-report_ipt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Cognitive therapy vs medications in the treatment of moderate to severe depression. Archives of General Psychiatry. 2005;62(4):409-16.","10.1001/archpsyc.62.4.409","BACKGROUND: There is substantial evidence that antidepressant medications treat moderate to severe depression effectively, but there is less data on cognitive therapy's effects in this population. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy in moderate to severe depression of antidepressant medications with cognitive therapy in a placebo-controlled trial. DESIGN: Random assignment to one of the following: 16 weeks of medications (n = 120), 16 weeks of cognitive therapy (n = 60), or 8 weeks of pill placebo (n = 60). SETTING: Research clinics at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tenn. PATIENTS: Two hundred forty outpatients, aged 18 to 70 years, with moderate to severe major depressive disorder. INTERVENTIONS: Some study subjects received paroxetine, up to 50 mg daily, augmented by lithium carbonate or desipramine hydrochloride if necessary; others received individual cognitive therapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale provided continuous severity scores and allowed for designations of response and remission. RESULTS: At 8 weeks, response rates in medications (50%) and cognitive therapy (43%) groups were both superior to the placebo (25%) group. Analyses based on continuous scores at 8 weeks indicated an advantage for each of the active treatments over placebo, each with a medium effect size. The advantage was significant for medication relative to placebo, and at the level of a nonsignificant trend for cognitive therapy relative to placebo. At 16 weeks, response rates were 58% in each of the active conditions; remission rates were 46% for medication, 40% for cognitive therapy. Follow-up tests of a site x treatment interaction indicated a significant difference only at Vanderbilt University, where medications were superior to cognitive therapy. Site differences in patient characteristics and in the relative experience levels of the cognitive therapists each appear to have contributed to this interaction. CONCLUSION: Cognitive therapy can be as effective as medications for the initial treatment of moderate to severe major depression, but this degree of effectiveness may depend on a high level of therapist experience or expertise.","Cognitive therapy vs medications in the treatment of moderate to severe depression","http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/PSYCH/5213/yoa30320.pdf","Arch Gen Psychiatry","DeRubeis, 2005","DeRubeis_2005_remission(cut-off)_hdrs_post_0_clinician_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA","A - Western"

Behavioral activation (BA) is a scalable intervention aligned with pregnant women's preference for nonpharmacological depression care. This is the first test of the effectiveness of BA for depression among pregnant women, which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of BA as compared with treatment as usual (TAU). Method: Pregnant women (mean age = 28.75 years; SD = 5.67) with depression symptoms were randomly assigned to BA (n = 86) or TAU (n = 77). Exclusion criteria included known bipolar or psychotic disorder or immediate self-harm risk. Follow-up assessment occurred 5 and 10 weeks postrandomization and 3 months postpartum using self-report measures of primary and secondary outcomes and putative targets. Results: Compared with TAU, BA was associated with significantly lower depressive symptoms (d = 0.34, p =.04) and higher remission (56.3% vs. 30.3%, p =.003). BA also demonstrated significant advantage on anxiety and perceived stress. Participants attended most BA sessions and reported high satisfaction. Participants in BA reported significantly higher levels of activation (d = 0.69, p <.0002) and environmental reward (d = 0.54, p <.003) than those who received TAU, and early change in both of these putative targets significantly mediated subsequent depression outcomes. Conclusions: BA is effective for pregnant women, offering significant depression, anxiety, and stress benefits, with mediation analyses supporting the importance of putative targets of activation and environmental reward.

METHOD: Eighty depressed (based on DSM-IV criteria) patients with Parkinson's disease participated in a randomized, controlled trial of CBT relative to clinical monitoring (1:1 ratio) in an academic medical center from April 2007 to July 2010. All patients continued to maintain stable medication regimens under the care of their personal physicians. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) total score was the primary outcome.

Methods Seventy-two people with PD (PWP) were randomized to T-CBT + TAU or TAU only. T-CBT tailored to PWPsâ unique needs was provided weekly for 3 months, then monthly during 6-month follow-up. CBT targeted negative thoughts (e.g., âI have no controlâ; âI am helplessâ) and behaviors (e.g., social withdrawal, excessive worry). It also trained care partners to help PWP practice healthy habits. Blind raters assessed outcomes at baseline, midtreatment, treatment end, and 1 and 6 months post-treatment.

Results T-CBT outperformed TAU on all depression, anxiety, and quality of life measures.

Patients were interviewed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV; those who met criteria for clinical depression (n = 81) were randomized to CBT (n = 45) or usual care (UC; n = 36). After completion of the UC period, 25 individuals were offered later CBT (UC + CBT). RESULTS: Main outcomes (depressive symptoms [BDI] and clinical depression [Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV]) were evaluated after 8 weeks using intention-to-treat principles and linear mixed models. Compared with the UC group, in the CBT group, there was greater decline in BDI scores (beta = 1.41; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.81-2.02; P = < .001) and greater remission of clinical depression (29 [64%] vs 9 [25%]; number need to treat, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.7-4.9; P < .001).

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of telephone-based reminiscence therapy on the depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, and social support of colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression. METHODS: Patients were divided randomly into a control group (CON, n=45), telephone support group (TS, n=45), and telephone-based reminiscence therapy group (TBR, n=45). Patients in TS and TBR groups received six 20-40-min telephone intervention sessions conducted weekly. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6weeks. The primary outcomes were changes on the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), which were used to evaluate depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes were changes in Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness (MUNSH), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) scores, which were used to evaluate anxiety symptoms, subjective well-being, and social support, respectively. RESULTS: After 6weeks, SDS and HAMD scores were significantly lower than pre-intervention baseline in the TBR group but not in the CON and TS groups (P<0.05). Both SAS and HAMA scores were significantly reduced in TBR and TS groups but not the CON group (P<0.05) following intervention; however, there was no significant difference in post-intervention scores between TS and TBR groups (P>0.05). Neither telephone support nor telephone-based reminiscence therapy improved subjective well-being or social support (P>0.05). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that telephone-based reminiscence therapy can reduce depression symptoms in colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy. Telephone-based reminiscence therapy may also improve anxiety, but no better than telephone support. Alternatively, telephone-based reminiscence therapy did not improve subjective well-being or social support. We suggest that clinicians provide appropriate telephone-based reminiscence therapy in long-term care institutions based on patient mental health status.","Telephone-based reminiscence therapy for colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression: a three-arm randomised controlled trial","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30515573 and https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00520-018-4566-6","Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer","Dong, 2019","Dong_2019_msd_hdrs_post_NA_clinician_lrt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of telephone-based reminiscence therapy on the depression, anxiety, subjective well-being, and social support of colorectal cancer patients undergoing postoperative chemotherapy complicated with depression. METHODS: Patients were divided randomly into a control group (CON, n=45), telephone support group (TS, n=45), and telephone-based reminiscence therapy group (TBR, n=45). Patients in TS and TBR groups received six 20-40-min telephone intervention sessions conducted weekly. Patients were assessed at baseline and at 6weeks. The primary outcomes were changes on the Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS) and Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD), which were used to evaluate depression symptoms. Secondary outcomes were changes in Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), Memorial University of Newfoundland Scale of Happiness (MUNSH), and Perceived Social Support Scale (PSSS) scores, which were used to evaluate anxiety symptoms, subjective well-being, and social support, respectively. RESULTS: After 6weeks, SDS and HAMD scores were significantly lower than pre-intervention baseline in the TBR group but not in the CON and TS groups (P<0.05).

We employed a randomized controlled trial design with 162 college adolescents in Southeastern region of Nigeria. One screening tool was used to ascertain the severity of depressive symptoms among the study participants at pre-treatment, post-treatment, and follow-up evaluations. In order to analyze the data collected, repeated measures analysis of variance and t test statistics were employed. Effect size of the intervention was determined using partial eta squared. The findings of the experiment showed that level of depressive symptoms of adolescents enrolled in the group cognitive behavioural therapy group was significantly reduced compared to the waitlisted control group at post-treatment evaluation.

If equally effective, then behavioural activation may be the preferred treatment option because it may be suitable for delivery by therapists with less training. This is the first randomised controlled trial to look at this possibility. AIMS: To examine whether generic mental health workers can deliver effective behavioural activation as a step-three high-intensity intervention. METHOD: A randomised controlled trial (ISRCTN27045243) comparing behavioural activation (n=24) with treatment as usual (n=23) in primary care. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses indicated a difference in favour of behavioural activation of -15.79 (95% CI -24.55 to -7.02) on the Beck Depression Inventory-II and Work and Social Adjustment Scale (mean difference -11.12, 95% CI -17.53 to -4.70).

METHOD: The study was undertaken at an acute psychiatric assessment and treatment centre based in the community. The centre operates an open referral system. The study sample was taken from clients attending the centre for mental health assessment who were subsequently diagnosed with unipolar depression. The total sample of 38 clients were allocated to either a treatment group (n = 19) or waiting list control group (n = 19) matching for age, gender and social support. The treatment group was divided into four groups. Each of these groups received 12 sessions of CBT, derived from the procedures described by Beck et al (1979). Data from dysfunctional thought diaries and Beck depression inventory scores were analysed. RESULTS: The results confirm those of previous outcome studies, that CBT is an effective treatment for depression. The results also indicate some interesting points relating to the expression of negative emotions as depression scores improve. It appeared that the expression of sadness preceded the expression of anger. Expression of sadness may be a precursor to expression of anger and necessary for recovery from depression. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study indicate that dimensions of an individual's personality, such as perfectionism and sociotrophy, may be influential in determining the outcomes of CBT. Further research in this area is indicated.","The effectiveness of cognitive behavioural therapy in depression",NA,"Nurs Stand","Embling, 2002","Embling_2002_msd_bdi-1_post_0_self-report_cbt_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

The primary outcome measure was depression symptoms as measured using Beck's Depression Inventory. Repeated-measures ANOVA and the Mann-Whitney U Test were used for data analysis. Results show that exposing inmates to the group-focused cognitive-behavioral coaching program significantly reduced the depressive symptoms of inmates in the treatment group compared with those in the control group.

Regular physical exercise can have anti-inflammatory effects. The present study examined whether behavioral activation with exercise affects inflammatory processes in MD. Ninety-eight patients with MD were randomly assigned to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) emphasizing exercise during behavioral activation (CBT-E), CBT with pleasurable low-energy activities as an active control condition (CBT-C) or a passive waiting list control group (WL). Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-6 production, and blood immune cell counts were analyzed at baseline and weeks 8 (post-behavioral activation) and 16 (post-treatment). Thirty non-depressed age- A nd sex-matched controls were included to examine potential immunological alterations in MD at baseline. Patients with MD exhibited higher levels of CRP, higher neutrophil and monocyte counts, lower IL-10 levels and reduced LPS-stimulated IL-6 production compared to controls (P<0.001-0.045). Multilevel modeling indicated that CBT-E was associated with increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 at weeks 8 and 16 compared to CBT-C and WL (P=0.004-0.018). CBT-E did not significantly affect other immunological makers in the total sample. A subgroup analysis including patients with potentially higher cardiovascular risk (CRP 3/41 g ml-1) indicated that CRP was reduced in CBT-E compared to CBT-C (P<0.007) and marginally reduced compared to WL (P<0.085) after week 16. The present findings provide new insights into immunological effects of behavioral treatments against depression. Behavioral activation in conjunction with exercise may have the potential to reverse, in part, immunological alterations in MD.","Immunological effects of behavioral activation with exercise in major depression: An exploratory randomized controlled trial","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L616206020 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/tp.2017.76 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=21583188&id=doi:10.1038%2Ftp.2017.76&atitle=Immunological+effects+of+behavioral+activation+with+exercise+in+major+depression%3A+An+exploratory+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=Transl.+Psychiatry&title=Translational+Psychiatry&volume=7&issue=5&spage=&epage=&aulast=Euteneuer&aufirst=F.&auinit=F.&aufull=Euteneuer+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=F&auinitm= and http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v7/n5/pdf/tp201776a.pdf","Translational Psychiatry","Euteneuer, 2017 -cbt-c","Euteneuer_2017_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_cbt_wl_cbt(cbt-c)_wl","A - Western"

Regular physical exercise can have anti-inflammatory effects. The present study examined whether behavioral activation with exercise affects inflammatory processes in MD. Ninety-eight patients with MD were randomly assigned to cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) emphasizing exercise during behavioral activation (CBT-E), CBT with pleasurable low-energy activities as an active control condition (CBT-C) or a passive waiting list control group (WL). Plasma levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated IL-6 production, and blood immune cell counts were analyzed at baseline and weeks 8 (post-behavioral activation) and 16 (post-treatment). Thirty non-depressed age- A nd sex-matched controls were included to examine potential immunological alterations in MD at baseline. Patients with MD exhibited higher levels of CRP, higher neutrophil and monocyte counts, lower IL-10 levels and reduced LPS-stimulated IL-6 production compared to controls (P<0.001-0.045). Multilevel modeling indicated that CBT-E was associated with increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 at weeks 8 and 16 compared to CBT-C and WL (P=0.004-0.018). CBT-E did not significantly affect other immunological makers in the total sample. A subgroup analysis including patients with potentially higher cardiovascular risk (CRP 3/41 g ml-1) indicated that CRP was reduced in CBT-E compared to CBT-C (P<0.007) and marginally reduced compared to WL (P<0.085) after week 16. The present findings provide new insights into immunological effects of behavioral treatments against depression. Behavioral activation in conjunction with exercise may have the potential to reverse, in part, immunological alterations in MD.","Immunological effects of behavioral activation with exercise in major depression: An exploratory randomized controlled trial","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L616206020 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/tp.2017.76 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=21583188&id=doi:10.1038%2Ftp.2017.76&atitle=Immunological+effects+of+behavioral+activation+with+exercise+in+major+depression%3A+An+exploratory+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=Transl.+Psychiatry&title=Translational+Psychiatry&volume=7&issue=5&spage=&epage=&aulast=Euteneuer&aufirst=F.&auinit=F.&aufull=Euteneuer+F.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=F&auinitm= and http://www.nature.com/tp/journal/v7/n5/pdf/tp201776a.pdf","Translational Psychiatry","Euteneuer, 2017 -cbt-e","Euteneuer_2017_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_cbt_wl_cbt(cbt-e)_wl","A - Western"

In follow-up comparisons, the CBT-T group had significantly more improvement on the SCL-20 than the UC group (treatment effect = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.01-0.70; p = 0.043) and completers of eight or more CBT sessions had significantly improved SCL-20 scores compared with the UC group (treatment effect = 0.43, 95% CI: 0.10-0.76; p = 0.011).

Both psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy are well-established treatments for depression and anxiety. The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of cognitive behavioral therapy with fluoxetine in the resolution or decreasing of depression and anxiety in infertile women. METHOD: In a randomized controlled clinical trial, 89 mild to moderate depressed infertile women (Beck scores 10-47) were recruited into three groups; cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), antidepressant therapy, and a control group. Twenty-nine participants in the CBT method received relaxation training, restructuring, and eliminating of negative automatic thoughts and dysfunctional attitudes to depression for 10 sessions. Thirty participants in the pharmacotherapy group took 20 mg fluoxetine daily for 90 days. Thirty control subjects did not receive any intervention. All participants completed the Beck Depression Inventory and Cattell Anxiety Inventory at the beginning and end of the study. Chi2 test, paired t-test, and ANOVA were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: The resolution of depression in the three groups was: fluoxetine group 50%, CBT 79.3%, and control 10%. The mean of the Beck scores at the beginning and end of the study was respectively: fluoxetine 23.2+/-8.6 versus 14.3+/-8.5(p<0.001), CBT 20.1+/-7.9 versus 7.7+/-4.8 (p<0.001), and control 19.8+/-8.5 versus 19.7+/-8.4 (p=0.9). Although both fluoxetine and CBT decreased significantly the mean of BDI scores more than that of the control group, the decrease in the CBT group was significantly more than fluoxetine group. The CBT method decreased significantly the mean of the Cattell scores more than the fluoxetine and control groups, but the decrease in the anxiety mean scores of that fluoxetine group was no more than that of control group. CONCLUSION: CBT was not only a reliable alternative to pharmacotherapy but also was superior to fluoxetine in the resolution or reducing of depression and anxiety of infertile women.

From pretreatment to 18-month follow-up the ACT participants improved significantly on measures of depression, general health, and quality of life compared to participants in the control condition. The conditions did not differ regarding sick leave and employment status at any time point. The results indicate that ACT is a promising treatment for depression.

Patients (N=129) were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to the two treatment conditions. They were assessed at 6-monthly intervals during the 18 months of treatment and at 24, 30 and 42 months during follow-up. The primary outcome measure was the 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), with complete remission defined as a HDRS-17 score 8, and partial remission defined as a HDRS-17 score 12. Secondary outcome measures included self-reported depression as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory - II, social functioning as evaluated by the Global Assessment of Functioning, subjective wellbeing as rated by the Clinical Outcomes in Routine Evaluation - Outcome Measure, and satisfaction with general activities as assessed by the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire. Complete remission was infrequent in both groups at the end of treatment (9.4% in the LTPP group vs. 6.5% in the control group) as well as at 42-month follow-up (14.9% vs. 4.4%). Partial remission was not significantly more likely in the LTPP than in the control group at the end of treatment (32.1% vs. 23.9%, p=0.37), but significant differences emerged during follow-up (24 months: 38.8% vs. 19.2%, p=0.03; 30 months: 34.7% vs. 12.2%, p=0.008; 42 months: 30.0% vs. 4.4%, p=0.001). Both observer-based and self-reported depression scores showed steeper declines in the LTPP group, alongside greater improvements on measures of social adjustment.

Setting Online and telephone. Population or sample Self-referred pregnant women (gestational week 1028 at intake) currently suffering from major depressive disorder. Methods 42 pregnant women (gestational week 1228) with major depression were randomised to either treatment as usual (TAU) provided at their antenatal clinic or to ICBT as an add-on to usual care. Main outcome measures The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured with the Montgomery-sberg depression rating scale-self report (MADRS-S). The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale and measures of anxiety and sleep were used. Credibility, satisfaction, adherence and utilization were also assessed. Results The ICBT group had significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms post treatment (p < 0.001, Hedges g =1.21) and were more likely to be responders (i.e. achieve a statistically reliable improvement) (RR = 0.36; p = 0.004).

RESULTS: Remission of depression occurred by 3 months in a higher proportion of patients in the cognitive behavior therapy (71%) and supportive stress-management (57%) arms than in the usual care group (33%) (chi(2)(2) = 12.22, P = .002). Covariate-adjusted Hamilton scores were lower in the cognitive behavior therapy (mean [standard error], 5.5 [1.0]) and the supportive stress-management (7.8 [1.0]) arms than in the usual care arm (10.7 [1.0]) at 3 months.

Supportive stress management was superior to usual care only on some of the measures. CONCLUSIONS: Both cognitive behavior therapy and supportive stress management are efficacious for treating depression after coronary artery bypass surgery, relative to usual care. Cognitive behavior therapy had greater and more durable effects than supportive stress management on depression and several secondary psychological outcomes.

JAMA Internal Medicine. 2015;175(11):1773-82.",NA,"IMPORTANCE Depression and inadequate self-care are common and interrelated problems that increase the risks of hospitalization and mortality in patients with heart failure (HF). OBJECTIVE To determine the efficacy of an integrative cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) intervention for depression and HF self-care. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Randomized clinical trial with single-blind outcome assessments. Eligible patients were enrolled atWashington University Medical Center in St Louis between January 4, 2010, and June 28, 2013. The primary data analyses were conducted in February 2015. The participants were 158 outpatients in New York Heart Association Class I, II, and III heart failure with comorbid major depression. INTERVENTIONS Cognitive behavior therapy delivered by experienced therapists plus usual care (UC), or UC alone. Usual care was enhanced in both groups with a structured HF education program delivered by a cardiac nurse. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas severity of depression at 6 months as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory. The Self-Care of Heart Failure Index Confidence and Maintenance subscales were coprimary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included measures of anxiety, depression, physical functioning, fatigue, social roles and activities, and quality of life. Hospitalizations and deaths were exploratory outcomes. RESULTS One hundred fifty-eight patients were randomized to UC (n = 79) or CBT (n = 79). Within each arm, 26 (33%) of the patients were taking an antidepressant at baseline. One hundred thirty-two (84%) of the participants completed the 6-month posttreatment assessments; 60 (76%) of the UC and 58 (73%) of the CBT participants completed every follow-up assessment (P = .88). Six-month depression scores were lower in the CBT than the UC arm on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) (12.8 [10.6] vs 17.3 [10.7]; P = .008). Remission rates differed on the BDI-II (46%vs 19%; number needed to treat [NNT] = 3.76; 95%CI, 3.62-3.90; P .001) and the Hamilton Depression Scale (51% vs 20%; NNT = 3.29; 95%CI, 3.15-3.43; P .001). The groups did not differ on the Self-Care Maintenance or Confidence subscales. The mean (SD) Beck Depression Inventory scores 6 months after randomization were lower in the CBT (12.8 [10.6]) than the UC arm (17.3 [10.7]), P = .008. There were no statistically significant differences between the groups on the Self-Care Maintenance or Confidence subscale scores or on physical functioning measures. Anxiety and fatigue scores were lower and mental- and HF-related quality of life and social functioning scores were higher at 6 months in the CBT than the UC arm, and there were fewer hospitalizations in the intervention than the UC arm. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE A CBT intervention that targets both depression and heart failure self-care is effective for depression but not for HF self-care or physical functioning relative to enhanced UC. Additional benefits include reduced anxiety and fatigue, improved social functioning, and better health-related quality of life.","Cognitive behavior therapy for depression and self-care in heart failure patients a randomized clinical trial","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L606772944 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jamainternmed.2015.5220 and http://elvis.ubvu.vu.nl:9003/vulink?sid=EMBASE&issn=21686106&id=doi:10.1001%2Fjamainternmed.2015.5220&atitle=Cognitive+behavior+therapy+for+depression+and+self-care+in+heart+failure+patients+a+randomized+clinical+trial&stitle=JAMA+Intern.+Med.&title=JAMA+Internal+Medicine&volume=175&issue=11&spage=1773&epage=1782&aulast=Freedland&aufirst=Kenneth+E.&auinit=K.E.&aufull=Freedland+K.E.&coden=&isbn=&pages=1773-1782&date=2015&auinit1=K&auinitm=E. and http://archinte.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/INTEMED/934633/ioi150083.pdf","JAMA Internal Medicine","Freedland, 2015","Freedland_2015_msd_bdi-2_post_NA_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

However, efforts to integrate the intervention at scale into the routines of community health workers who delivered the THP when it was first evaluated were compromised by the competing responsibilities of community health workers. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of THP peer-delivered (THPP) in Goa, India. Methods: In this single-blind, individually randomised controlled trial, we recruited pregnant women aged 18 years or older who scored at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) from antenatal clinics in Goa. Participants were randomly allocated (1:1) to receive enhanced usual care (EUC; so-called because, in India, perinatal depression is not typically treated) only (control group) or THPP in addition to EUC (intervention group) in randomly sized blocks that were stratified by area of residence (urban or rural). Group allocations were concealed from participants and researchers before assignments were made by use of sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The primary outcomes were the severity of depressive symptoms (assessed by PHQ-9 score) and the prevalence of remission (defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5) in participants with available data 6 months after childbirth, which was assessed by researchers who were masked to treatment allocations. We analysed outcomes by intention to treat, adjusting for covariates that were defined a priori or that showed imbalance at baseline. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02104232. Findings: Between Oct 24, 2014, and June 24, 2016, we assessed 118 260 women for their eligibility for screening, of whom 111 851 (946%) women were ineligible. 6409 (54%) women were eligible for screening and 6369 (994%) of these women consented to be screened with the PHQ-9 (40 women did not consent), of whom 333 (52%) screened positive for depression (defined as a PHQ-9 score of at least 10). We enrolled 280 (841%) women with perinatal depression; 140 women were assigned to the THPP and EUC group and 140 women to the EUC only group. The final treatment was given on May 27, 2017. The final 6-month outcome assessment was completed on June 9, 2017. At 6 months after birth, 122 (87%) women in the THPP and EUC group and 129 (92%) women in the EUC only group were assessed for the primary outcome. There was a higher prevalence of remission at 6 months after birth in the THPP and EUC group compared with the EUC only group (89 [73%] women in the intervention group vs 77 [60%] women in the control group; prevalence ratio 121, 95% CI 101 to 145; p = 004), but there was no evidence of a difference in symptom severity between the groups (mean PHQ-9 score 347 [SD 449] in the intervention group vs 448 [511] in the control group; standardised mean difference 018, 95% CI 043 to 007; p = 016). There was no evidence of significant differences in serious adverse events between the groups. Interpretation: THPP had a moderate effect on remission from perinatal depression over the 6-month postnatal period. THPP is relatively cheap to deliver and is cost-saving through reduced health-care, time and productivity costs.

At 6 months after birth, 122 (87%) women in the THPP and EUC group and 129 (92%) women in the EUC only group were assessed for the primary outcome. There was a higher prevalence of remission at 6 months after birth in the THPP and EUC group compared with the EUC only group (89 [73%] women in the intervention group vs 77 [60%] women in the control group; prevalence ratio 121, 95% CI 101 to 145; p = 004), but there was no evidence of a difference in symptom severity between the groups (mean PHQ-9 score 347 [SD 449] in the intervention group vs 448 [511] in the control group; standardised mean difference 018, 95% CI 043 to 007; p = 016). There was no evidence of significant differences in serious adverse events between the groups. Interpretation: THPP had a moderate effect on remission from perinatal depression over the 6-month postnatal period. THPP is relatively cheap to deliver and is cost-saving through reduced health-care, time and productivity costs.

We developed a highly-structured manualized eight-session cognitive-behavioral program with a focus on subthreshold depression in the workplace and to be administered via telephone by trained psychotherapists (tCBT). METHODS: We conducted a parallel-group, non-blinded randomized controlled trial of tCBT in addition to the pre-existing Employee Assistance Program (EAP) versus EAP alone among workers with subthreshold depression at a large manufacturing company in Japan. The primary outcomes were depression severity as measured with Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) and presenteeism as measured with World Health Organization Health and Work Productivity Questionnaire (HPQ). In the course of the trial the follow-up period was shortened in order to increase acceptability of the study. RESULTS: The planned sample size was 108 per arm but the trial was stopped early due to low accrual. Altogether 118 subjects were randomized to tCBT+EAP (n = 58) and to EAP alone (n = 60).

The treatment of depression Is limited by the scarcity of mental health professionals, as reflected In the mental health atlas of the World Health Organization. Method: A randomised controlled trial that was not blinded was conducted. Family doctors referred patients older than 60 years who were suspected to hove depression to the screening module. The PHQ-9 questionnaire, the Six-Item Screener, and previous diagnosis for psychiatric disorders were collected. Major depression was excluded. Those with 0 score from two to six on the PHQ-9 and with no comorbidities were referred to the Baseline Phase. A simple random process without blocking was applied. Groups of 7-10 participants engaged In weekly sessions over the course of three months. The control group was referred to their family physician. Reduction In depression score of the PHQ-9 was the main outcome. Results and discussion: There were 40 patients In the control group (CG) and 41 in the Intervention group (IG). 84% were women, 4 1% married and 4 1% reported at least primary education. The mean age for the GC was 69.7 years vs. 71.3 in the Gl. The baseline mean MMSE score was 23.7 In the GC and 24.1 In the IG. No significant baseline differences between groups were reported. In the IG, 56% of the participants (n=23) displayed a decrease that was greater than or equal to 5 points on the PHQ-9 compared with 30% (n = l 2) In the control group.

The evidence for effective worker-directed interventions for employees with depressive symptoms is limited. Treating employees with depressive symptoms before sick leave via the Internet could be beneficial and cost saving. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we developed and tested the effectiveness of a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms. We report on the posttreatment effectiveness of the intervention. METHODS: This study is a two-arm randomized controlled trial comparing a Web-based guided self-help course to care as usual (CAU). We recruited employees from 6 different companies via the companies' intranet and posters. The main inclusion criterion was elevated depressive symptoms as measured by a score of >/=16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). The intervention (Happy@Work) was based on problem-solving treatment and cognitive therapy and consisted of 6 weekly lessons. Participants were asked to submit their weekly assignment via the website after completion. They subsequently received feedback from a coach via the website. Self-report questionnaires on depressive symptoms (CES-D; primary outcome), anxiety measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), burnout measured by the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI), and work performance measured by the Health and Work Performance Questionnaire (HPQ; secondary outcomes) were completed at baseline and at posttreatment. RESULTS: A total of 231 employees were randomized to either the intervention group (n=116) or CAU (n=115).The posttreatment assessment was completed by 171 (74.0%) participants. Both the intervention and the CAU group showed significant improvements in the primary outcome of depressive symptoms, but no differences between the conditions was found (d=0.16, 95% CI -0.10 to 0.41, P=.29). Significant but small effects in favor of the intervention group were found for anxiety symptoms (d=0.16, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.42, P=.04) and exhaustion (d=0.17, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.43, P=.02). CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that a Web-based guided self-help course for employees with depressive symptoms was not more effective in reducing depressive symptoms among employees than CAU.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a home-based intervention alleviates depressive symptoms and improves quality of life in older African Americans. DESIGN: Parallel, randomized trial stratified by recruitment site. Interviewers assessing outcomes were blinded to treatment assignment. (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT00511680). SETTING: A senior center and participants' homes from 2008 to 2010. PATIENTS: African Americans aged 55 years or older with depressive symptoms. INTERVENTION: A multicomponent, home-based intervention delivered by social workers or a wait-list control group that received the intervention at 4 months. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reported depression severity at 4 months (primary outcome) and depression knowledge, quality of life, behavioral activation, anxiety, function, and remission at 4 and 8 months. RESULTS: Of 208 participants (106 and 102 in the intervention and wait-list groups, respectively), 182 (89 and 93, respectively) completed 4 months and 160 (79 and 81, respectively) completed 8 months.

Compassionate hearts protect against wandering minds: Self-compassion moderates the effect of mind-wandering on depression. Spirituality in Clinical Practice 2018; 5(3): 155-69.","10.1037/scp0000168","Depression is associated with high levels of mind-wandering and low levels of self-compassion. However, little is known about whether and how these two factors interact with one another to influence depressive symptoms. The current study examined the interaction between mind-wandering, self-compassion, and depressive symptoms in a depressed sample and tested the effects of an 8-week mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) program on these constructs. At baseline, mind-wandering was associated with higher depressive symptoms only among individuals with low self-compassion. Self-compassion additionally predicted depressive improvement.

Two participants dropped out from WL and none dropped out of immediate MCT treatment. Participants receiving MCT improved significantly more than the WL group. Large controlled effect sizes were observed for both depressive (d = 2.51) and anxious symptoms (d = 1.92). Approximately 7080% could be classified as recovered at post-treatment and 6 months follow-up following immediate MCT, whilst 5% of the WL patients recovered during the waiting period.

Alternative treatments are needed that are non-stigmatising, accessible and can be prescribed by general medical practitioners. Aims To compare the effectiveness of three interventions for depression: physical exercise, internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy (ICBT) and treatment as usual (TAU). A secondary aim was to assess changes in self-rated work capacity. Method A total of 946 patients diagnosed with mild to moderate depression were recruited through primary healthcare centres across Sweden and randomly assigned to one of three 12-week interventions (trail registry: KCTR study ID: KT20110063). Patients were reassessed at 3 months (response rate 78%). Results Patients in the exercise and ICBT groups reported larger improvements in depressive symptoms compared with TAU. Work capacity improved over time in all three groups (no significant differences). Conclusions Exercise and ICBT were more effective than TAU by a general medical practitioner, and both represent promising non-stigmatising treatment alternatives for patients with mild to moderate depression.","Physical exercise and internet-based cognitive-behavioural therapy in the treatment of depression: Randomised controlled trial","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L605976055 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.bp.114.160101 and http://elvis.ubvu.vu.nl:9003/vulink?sid=EMBASE&issn=14721465&id=doi:10.1192%2Fbjp.bp.114.160101&atitle=Physical+exercise+and+internet-based+cognitive-behavioural+therapy+in+the+treatment+of+depression%3A+Randomised+controlled+trial&stitle=Br.+J.+Psychiatry&title=British+Journal+of+Psychiatry&volume=207&issue=3&spage=227&epage=234&aulast=Hallgren&aufirst=Mats&auinit=M.&aufull=Hallgren+M.&coden=BJPYA&isbn=&pages=227-234&date=2015&auinit1=M&auinitm= and http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/207/3/227.full.pdf","British Journal of Psychiatry","Hallgren, 2015","Hallgren_2015_msd_madrs_post_0_clinician_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

The interventional model used was the Modified Teaching Kids to Cope (MTKC), and the control group received no treatment. Overall, using CBT showed a significant improvement in the outcome measures. At postintervention, students had lower scores on perceived stress, lower depressive symptoms, less use of avoidance coping strategies, and more use of approach coping strategies.

In a controlled randomized trial we compare a cognitive behavioral group intervention with a waiting list control condition. It is expected that cognitive behavior therapy is more efficient in reducing depressive symptoms than the control group at post-treatment as well as at follow-up. Method: A total of 100 older adults presently fulfilling the diagnosis of a depressive disorder but not showing any signs of cognitive impairment were randomly assigned (ratio 2:1) to either cognitive behavior therapy (N = 65) or to waiting list condition (N = 35). Assessment took place at pretreatment, after 3 months of treatment or waiting, and after 6 months follow-up. Results: As expected, cognitive behavior group therapy was superior to waiting list control in all measures at post-treatment as well as at follow-up (intent-to-treat analysis). These effects are statistically and clinically relevant and not influenced by parallel treatment with antidepressant medication. After cognitive behavior therapy 36 patients were in complete remission but only 4 after three months of waiting. Six patients in the control group became even worse during the 3 months waiting while only 1 patient under cognitive behavior therapy has to be considered as treatment failure. Discussion: Cognitive behavioral group treatment is a well accepted, successful intervention for older adults. Waiting for treatment is problematic. It does not only produce no changes in symptomatology but even leads to worsening of depression in a large number of subjects. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Evidence-based treatment recommendations need to be derived directly from this diagnostically heterogeneous group. The primary aim was to assess the efficacy of sertraline and cognitive-behavioural group therapy for treatment of depressed primary-care patients, the secondary aim was to evaluate if receiving treatment according to free choice is associated with a better outcome than randomization to a particular treatment. We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-centre, 10-wk trial with five arms: sertraline (flexible dosages up to 200 mg/d) (n = 83); placebo (n = 83); manual-guided cognitive-behavioural group therapy (one individual session and nine group sessions per 90 min) (n = 61); guided self-help group (control condition, n = 59); and treatment with sertraline or cognitive-behavioural group therapy according to patients' choice (n = 82). From 1099 consecutively screened adult patients, 368 formed the intent-to-treat population with milder forms of depression. Primary outcome was a global efficacy measure combining z-converted Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and clinician-rated Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology scores. Sertraline was superior to placebo (p = 0.03). Outcome for guided self-help groups was worse compared to cognitive-behavioural group therapy (p = 0.002) and compared to all other treatment arms including pill placebo (secondary analyses). Outcome in the patients' choice arm was similar to that in the sertraline and cognitive-behavioural group therapy. Overall, sertraline is efficacious in primary-care patients with milder forms of depression. The superiority of cognitive-behavioural group therapy over guided self-help groups might partly be explained by 'nocebo' effects of the latter.","Effects of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in depressed primary-care patients: a randomized, controlled trial including a patients' choice arm","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/815/CN-00728815/frame.html and http://ijnp.oxfordjournals.org/content/ijnp/13/1/31.full.pdf","International journal of neuropsychopharmacology","Hegerl, 2010","Hegerl_2010_response(50%&cut-off)_hdrs_post_NA_clinician_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA","A - Western"

We tested the hypothesis that stepwise psychotherapy improves depressive symptoms more than simple information. Methods: In a multicenter trial, we randomized 570 CAD patients scoring higher than 7 on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression subscale to usual care plus either one information session (UC-IS) or stepwise psychotherapy (UC-PT). UC-PT patients received three individual psychotherapy sessions. Those still depressed were offered group psychotherapy (25 sessions). The primary outcome was changed in the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-depression scores from baseline to 18 months. Preplanned subgroup analyses examined whether treatment responses differed by patients' sex and personality factors (Type D). Results: The mean (standard deviation) depression scores declined from 10.4 (2.5) to 8.7 (4.1) at 18 months in UC-PT and from 10.4 (2.5) to 8.9 (3.9) in UC-IS (both p < .001). There was no significant group difference in change of depressive symptoms (group-by-time effect, p = .90). Preplanned subgroup analyses revealed no differences in treatment effects between men versus women (ptreatment-by-sex interaction = .799) but a significant treatment-by-Type D interaction on change in depressive symptoms (p = .026) with a trend for stronger improvement with UC-PT than UC-IS in Type D patients (n = 341, p = .057) and no such difference in improvement in patients without Type D (n = 227, p = .54). Conclusions: Stepwise psychotherapy failed to improve depressive symptoms in CAD patients more than UC-IS. The intervention might be beneficial for depressed CAD patients with Type D personality. However, this finding requires further study.

The clinical effectiveness of web-based cognitive behavioral therapy with face-to-face therapist support for depressed primary care patients: randomized controlled trial. Journal of medical Internet research 2013; 15(8): e153.","10.2196/jmir.2714","BACKGROUND: Most patients with mild to moderate depression receive treatment in primary care, but despite guideline recommendations, structured psychological interventions are infrequently delivered. Research supports the effectiveness of Internet-based treatment for depression; however, few trials have studied the effect of the MoodGYM program plus therapist support. The use of such interventions could improve the delivery of treatment in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a guided Web-based intervention for mild to moderate depression, which could be suitable for implementation in general practice. METHODS: Participants (N=106) aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to a treatment condition comprising 6 weeks of therapist-assisted Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or to a 6-week delayed treatment condition. The intervention included the Norwegian version of the MoodGYM program, brief face-to-face support from a psychologist, and reminder emails. The primary outcome measure, depression symptoms, was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Secondary outcome measures included the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D). All outcomes were based on self-report and were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Postintervention measures were completed by 37 (71%) and 47 (87%) of the 52 participants in the intervention and 54 participants in the delayed treatment group, respectively. Linear mixed-models analyses revealed a significant difference in time trends between the groups for the BDI-II, (P=.002), for HADS depression and anxiety subscales (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively), and for the SWLS (P<.001). No differential group effects were found for the BAI and the EQ-5D. In comparison to the control group, significantly more participants in the intervention group experienced recovery from depression as measured by the BDI-II. Of the 52 participants in the treatment program, 31 (60%) adhered to the program, and overall treatment satisfaction was high. The reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms was largely maintained at 6-month follow-up, and positive gains in life satisfaction were partly maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention combining MoodGYM and brief therapist support can be an effective treatment of depression in a sample of primary care patients. The intervention alleviates depressive symptoms and has a significant positive effect on anxiety symptoms and satisfaction with life.

The use of such interventions could improve the delivery of treatment in primary care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and acceptability of a guided Web-based intervention for mild to moderate depression, which could be suitable for implementation in general practice. METHODS: Participants (N=106) aged between 18 and 65 years were recruited from primary care and randomly allocated to a treatment condition comprising 6 weeks of therapist-assisted Web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), or to a 6-week delayed treatment condition. The intervention included the Norwegian version of the MoodGYM program, brief face-to-face support from a psychologist, and reminder emails. The primary outcome measure, depression symptoms, was measured by the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Secondary outcome measures included the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire (EQ-5D). All outcomes were based on self-report and were assessed at baseline, postintervention, and at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Postintervention measures were completed by 37 (71%) and 47 (87%) of the 52 participants in the intervention and 54 participants in the delayed treatment group, respectively. Linear mixed-models analyses revealed a significant difference in time trends between the groups for the BDI-II, (P=.002), for HADS depression and anxiety subscales (P<.001 and P=.001, respectively), and for the SWLS (P<.001). No differential group effects were found for the BAI and the EQ-5D. In comparison to the control group, significantly more participants in the intervention group experienced recovery from depression as measured by the BDI-II. Of the 52 participants in the treatment program, 31 (60%) adhered to the program, and overall treatment satisfaction was high. The reduction of depression and anxiety symptoms was largely maintained at 6-month follow-up, and positive gains in life satisfaction were partly maintained. CONCLUSIONS: The intervention combining MoodGYM and brief therapist support can be an effective treatment of depression in a sample of primary care patients. The intervention alleviates depressive symptoms and has a significant positive effect on anxiety symptoms and satisfaction with life.

Design - controlled, random order trial. Setting - Health centres in Edinburgh and Livingston. Patients - Sixty women identified as depressed by screening at six weeks post partum and by psychiatric interview at about 13 weeks post partum. Five women did not wish to participate, and a further five did not complete the trial. Age, social and obstetrics factors, and diagnosis were similar in women who completed the trial and those who withdrew. Intervention - Eight weekly counselling visits by health visitors who had been given a short training in counselling for postnatal depression. End point - Reduction of depression. Measurements and main results - Standardised psychiatric interviews and a 10 point self report scale were used to identify depression before and after intervention. The psychiatrist was not told to which group women were allocated. After three months 18 (69%) of the 26 women in the treatment group had fully recovered compared with nine (38%) of the 24 in the control group. The difference between the groups was thus 32% (95% confidence interval 5 to 58).

Aims: To assess the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 1-day cognitivebehavioural therapy (CBT) self-confidence workshops in reducing depression. Anxiety, self-esteem, prognostic indicators as well as access were also assessed. Method: An open randomised controlled trial (RCT) waiting list control design with 12-week follow-up was used (trial registration: ISRCTN26634837). A total of 459 adult participants with depression (Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores of 14) self-referred and 382 participants (83%) were followed up. Results: At follow-up, experimental and control participants differed significantly on the BDI, with an effect size of 0.55. Anxiety and self-esteem also differed. Of those who participated, 25% were GP non-consulters and 32% were from Black and minority ethnic groups. Women benefited more than men on depression scores. The intervention has a 90% chance of being considered cost-effective if a depression-free day is valued at 14. Conclusions: Self-confidence workshops appear promising in terms of clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and access by difficult-to-engage groups.

METHODS: 249 primiparous women with mild to moderate postpartum depression were recruited and randomly assigned to a control group (n=128), which received conventional postpartum care, or to a psychological intervention group (n=121), which received conventional postpartum care combined with psychological intervention. The Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were employed to evaluate depression and sleep quality, respectively. RESULTS: 104 patients in the intervention group and 109 in the control group completed the study. After intervention, the EPDS score, PSQI score, sleep quality score, sleep latency score, sleep duration score, habitual sleep efficiency score, sleep disturbance score, and daytime dysfunction score were significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group. The EPDS and PSQI scores of each group at different time points after intervention were markedly decreased compared with those before intervention, and the reduction in the intervention group was more evident than that in the control group.

Methods: A controlled trial was conducted to compare patients who received the behavioural intervention with untreated controls on measures of health outcomes. A total of 31 intervention group participants and 30 controls were selected from patients that met the inclusion criteria from a hospital-based endocrinology outpatient department. The outcome measures including depressive symptoms, glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, BMI, and both physical and mental quality of life were collected before (T1), after (T2), and after 90 days (T3) following the intervention. Results: The experimental group showed a significant reduction in glycosylated haemoglobin, fasting glucose, and depressive symptoms and a significant increase in physical quality of life and mental quality of life at T2 and T3, while patients in the control group with usual care showed no changes over time. Conclusion: The behavioural intervention facilitated a significant improvement in psychological adjustment and glycemic control, thus strengthening diabetes control skills and leading to healthy outcomes. It is feasible that nurses and psychiatrists can deliver the behavioural intervention for diabetes patients to decrease their depressive symptoms. Sharing discussion and problem-solving experiences is particularly helpful method for self-control, and these will be beneficially influential on further research.

Cognitive behavioral psychotherapy (CBT) has shown to be effective in older depressive patients living in the community. To date, CBT has not been applied to older patients with acute physical illness and comorbid depression. Objectives To evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in depressed geriatric patients, hospitalized for acute somatic illness. Design Randomized controlled trial with waiting list control group. Setting Postdischarge intervention in a geriatric day clinic; follow-up evaluations at the patients homes. Participants A total of 155 randomized patients, hospitalized for acute somatic illness, aged 826years and suffering from depression [Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) scores >7]. Exclusion criteria were dementia, delirium, and terminal state of medical illness. Intervention Fifteen, weekly group sessions based on a CBT manual. Commencement of psychotherapy immediately after discharge in the intervention group and a 4-month waiting list interval with usual care in the control group. Measurements HADS depression total score after 4months. Secondary endpoints were functional, cognitive, psychosocial and physical status, resource utilization, caregiver burden, and amount of contact with physician. Results The intervention group improved significantly in depression scores (HADS baseline 18.8; after 4months 11.4), whereas the control group deteriorated (HADS baseline 18.1; after 4months 21.6). Significant improvement in the intervention group, but not in the control group, was observed for most secondary outcome parameters such as the Barthel and Karnofsky indexes. Intervention effects were less pronounced in patients with cognitive impairment or acute fractures. Conclusions CBT is feasible and highly effective in geriatric patients. The benefits extend beyond effective recovery and include improvement in physical and functional parameters. Early diagnosis, good access to psychotherapy, and early intervention could improve care for depressive older patients.

To meet the call for more ""transportable"" interventions, we conducted a pilot study to test a group cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) for depression and substance use that was designed for delivery by outpatient substance abuse treatment counselors. Seventy-three outpatient clients were randomized to usual care enhanced with group CBT or usual care alone and assessed at three time points (baseline and 3 and 6 months postbaseline). Our results demonstrated that the treatment was acceptable and feasible for delivery by substance abuse treatment staff despite challenges with recruiting clients. Both depressive symptoms and substance use were reduced by the intervention but were not significantly different from the control group. These results suggest that further research is warranted to enhance the effectiveness of treatment for co-occurring disorders in these settings.","Treating depression and substance use: a randomized controlled trial","http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0740547211002613/1-s2.0-S0740547211002613-main.pdf?_tid=aec4d402-5871-11e5-9b3b-00000aacb362&acdnat=1441968279_4fef6062c5680b5f3ea4ea6e244f40ff","J Subst Abuse Treat","Hunter, 2012","Hunter_2012_remission(cut-off)_bdi-1_post_NA_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the Learning through Play Plus program (LTP Plus) - a parenting program integrated with Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT). Methods A total of 247 women with symptoms of depression in Karachi, Pakistan were assigned randomly to either LTP Plus or routine care (Clinical Trials Identifier: NCT00835016). Symptoms of maternal depression were measured using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) at 3 and 6 months after baseline. Results At 3 months, there was a significant reduction in the EPDS scores in the intervention group compared to the routine group (adjusted mean difference [AMD] -3.65, 95% CI -6.14 to -1.15, p < 0.004). This effect was sustained at 6 months (AMD -2.62, 95% CI -4.43 to -0.81, p < 0.005). These women also reported less parental distress and disability.

METHODS: Outpatients with DSM-III-R major depressive disorder and atypical features (N = 108) were treated in a 10-week, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing acute-phase cognitive therapy or clinical management plus either phenelzine sulfate or placebo. Atypical features were defined as reactive mood plus at least 2 additional symptoms: hypersomnia, hyperphagia, leaden paralysis, or lifetime sensitivity to rejection. RESULTS: With the use of an intention-to-treat strategy, the response rates (21-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score, < or =9) were significantly greater after cognitive therapy (58%) and phenelzine (58%) than after pill placebo (28%).

This article details the feasibility and efficacy of a 6-week, culturally tailored, cognitive-behavioral intervention offered to rural, minority, low-income women at risk for antepartum depression. Methods: A total of 146 pregnant women were stratified by high risk for antepartum depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale [EPDS] score of 10 or higher) or by low-moderate risk (EPDS score of 4-9) and randomized to a cognitive-behavioral intervention or treatment as usual. Differences in mean change of EPDS and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)-II scores for low-moderate and high-risk women in the cognitive-behavioral intervention and treatment as usual for the full sample were assessed from baseline (T1), posttreatment (T2), and one-month follow-up (T3), and for African American women in the subsample. Results: Both the cognitive-behavioral intervention and treatment-as-usual groups had significant reductions in the EPDS scores from T1 to T2 and T1 to T3. In women at high risk for depression (n = 62), there was no significant treatment effect from T1 to T2 or T3 for the EPDS. However, in low-moderate risk women, there was a significantly greater mean change in the BDI-II scores from significant decrease in the BDI-II scores from T1 to T2 (4.92 vs 0.59, P = .018) and T1 to T3 (5.67 vs 1.51, P =04). Also, the cognitive-behavioral intervention significantly reduced EPDS scores for African American women at high risk (n = 43) from T1 to T2 (5.59 vs 2.18, P = .02) and from T1 to T3 (6.32 vs 3.14, P =04). Discussion: A cognitive-behavioral intervention integrated within prenatal clinics is feasible in this sample, although attrition rates were high. Compared to treatment as usual, the cognitive-behavioral intervention reduced depressive symptoms for African American women at high risk for antepartum depression and for the full sample of women at low-moderate risk for antepartum depression.

A survey of 4000 women within 4-6 weeks postpartum in 80 communities in Shenzhen, China was performed using random cluster sampling method. By employing Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) as a screening tool, the positive women (defined as EPDS >/=10) were randomly divided into intervention group and control group at a ratio of 1:2. The women in the intervention group were treated by means of mailing postpartum depression prevention and treatment knowledge manual, face-to-face counseling, and telephone psychological counseling interventions aiming at individual risk factors, while those in the control group were treated with conventional methods. EPDS scores were assessed in these two groups again at 6th month postpartum. Totally, 3907 valid questionnaires were obtained. All the 771 positive women were divided into two groups: 257 in the intervention group, and 514 in the control group. At 6th month postpartum, the EPDS scores in the intervention group were decreased significantly, from baseline stage (12.84+/-3.02) to end stage (3.05+/-2.93), while EPDS scores in the control group were reduced from 12.44+/-2.78 to 6.94+/-4.02. There were significant differences in the EPDS scores at end stage between the two groups (t=13.059, P<0.001). Psychological intervention can reduce postpartum depression, with better maternal compliance. It is feasible and necessary to establish postpartum depression screening and psychological intervention model in community-hospital and include the postpartum depression screening, intervention, and follow-up into the conventional healthcare.","Psychological intervention for postpartum depression","http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/352/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11596-014-1297-x.pdf?auth66=1427209479_f9b9ff03bd22c12c4794d4ed4b4074c9&ext=.pdf and http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/352/art%253A10.1007%252Fs11596-014-1297-x.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs11596-014-1297-x&token2=exp=1441969485~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F352%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs11596-014-1297-x.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs11596-014-1297-x*~hmac=5dde6f51989c0bfecb8ed596598da676d2d259c9ae6f4a1a4a50878d4b7e30ed","J Huazhong Univ Sci Technolog Med Sci","Jiang, 2014","Jiang_2014_msd_epds_post_NA_self-report_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Using the Internet to provide psychodynamic treatments is one way of improving access to psychological treatments for MDD. The aim of this randomised controlled trial was to investigate the efficacy of an Internet-based psychodynamic guided self-help treatment for MDD. METHODS: Ninety-two participants who were diagnosed with MDD according to the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview were randomised to treatment or an active control. The treatment consisted of nine treatment modules based on psychodynamic principles with online therapist contact. The active control condition was a structured support intervention and contained psychoeducation and scheduled weekly contacts online. Both interventions lasted for 10 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). RESULTS: Mixed-effects model analyses of all randomised participants showed that participants receiving Internet-based PDT made large and superior improvements compared with the active control group on the BDI-II (between-group Cohen's d = 1.11). Treatment effects were maintained at a 10-month follow-up.

The treatment was compared both to standardized (non-tailored) Internet-based treatment and to an active control group in the form of a monitored online discussion group. Both guided self-help treatments were based on cognitive behavior therapy and lasted for 10 weeks. The discussion group consisted of weekly discussion themes related to depression and the treatment of depression. METHODS: A total of 121 participants with diagnosed major depressive disorder and with a range of comorbid symptoms were randomized to three groups. The tailored treatment consisted of a prescribed set of modules targeting depression as well as comorbid problems. The standardized treatment was a previously tested guided self-help program for depression. RESULTS: From pre-treatment to post-treatment, both treatment groups improved on measures of depression, anxiety and quality of life. The results were maintained at a 6-month follow-up. Subgroup analyses showed that the tailored treatment was more effective than the standardized treatment among participants with higher levels of depression at baseline and more comorbidity, both in terms of reduction of depressive symptoms and on recovery rates. In the subgroup with lower baseline scores of depression, few differences were seen between treatments and the discussion group. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that tailored Internet-based treatment for depression is effective and that addressing comorbidity by tailoring may be one way of making guided self-help treatments more effective than standardized approaches in the treatment of more severe depression.

It is the first fully powered randomized trial of any treatment (pharmacological or psychosocial) targeting MDD among incarcerated individuals. METHOD: One hundred eighty-one male (n = 117) and female (n = 64) prisoners from prison facilities in 2 states were randomized to group IPT (delivered by master's-level and nonspecialist prison counselors) for MDD plus prison treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU alone. Participants' average age was 39 (range = 20-61); 20% were African American and 19% were Hispanic. Outcomes assessed at posttreatment and 3-month follow-up included depressive symptoms (primary; assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression), suicidality (assessed with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation and Beck Hopelessness Scale), in-prison functioning (i.e., enrollment in correctional programs; discipline reports; aggression/victimization; and social support), remission from MDD, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. RESULTS: IPT reduced depressive symptoms, hopelessness, and posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms, and increased rates of MDD remission relative to prison TAU alone. Effects on hopelessness were particularly strong. Cost per patient was $2,054 including costs for IPT training and supervision or $575 without these costs. For providers running their second or subsequent IPT group, cost per additional week in remission from MDD (relative to TAU alone) was $524 ($148 excluding training and supervision costs, which would not be needed for established programs). CONCLUSIONS: IPT is effective and cost-effective and we recommend its use for MDD among prisoners. It is currently the only treatment for MDD evaluated among incarcerated individuals.

Half were randomized to the intervention arm and half to delayed intervention/usual care. The intervention consisted of large print written and audio tools incorporating cognitive-behavioral principles plus three 10-minute telephone calls from a lay coach. Eight-week follow-up data were collected by telephone.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the 8-week change in depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Secondary outcomes included anxiety, life space and self-efficacy.RESULTS: The baseline mean logMAR visual acuity was 0.37 (SD=0.20), and the baseline mean Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score was 9.5 (SD=3.9) indicating moderate depressive symptoms. After adjusting for baseline imbalances in visual acuity, the intervention reduced depressive symptoms by 2.1 points more than usual care (P=0.040). The intervention was not associated with the secondary outcomes (P>0.05).CONCLUSIONS: Self-care tools plus telephone coaching led to a modest improvement in depressive symptoms in patients with age-related eye disease. Additional research on how to maximize their effect is necessary.BACKGROUND: Depression is very common in people with age-related eye disease. Our goal was to determine if self-care tools plus limited telephone support could reduce depressive symptoms in patients with age-related macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy.","Self-care tools to treat depressive symptoms in patients with age-related eye disease: a randomized controlled clinical trial","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/617/CN-01413617/frame.html and http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/ceo.12890/asset/ceo12890.pdf?v=1&t=je03ld5i&s=10a2fa0007b6137283c3a64015e71766f97055bb","Clinical & experimental ophthalmology","Kamga, 2017","Kamga_2017_msd_phq-9_post_NA_self-report_cbt_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

Results: In Intention-To-Treat analyses, MI-SMD was associated with a more favorable trajectory of PHQ-9 depressive symptom scores than SMD alone (randomization group time interaction estimate = 0.13, p = .018). At 36 weeks, MI-SMD was associated with improved depressive symptoms (Cohen's d = 0.41, 95% CI [0.11, 0.72]) and remission rate (Success Rate Difference = 14.53 [1.79, 27.26]) relative to SMD alone.

This research evaluated the effects of brief cognitive-behavioral or social support group therapy with this population. METHOD: Sixty-eight depressed men with HIV infection were randomly assigned to one of three conditions: eight-session cognitive-behavioral groups, eight-session social support groups, or a comparison condition. Before and after intervention and at 3-month follow-up, all participants were individually assessed by using measures of symptoms of distress as well as substance use and sexual practices. RESULTS: Relative to the comparison group, both the cognitive-behavioral and social support group therapies produced reductions in depression, hostility, and somatization. The social support intervention also produced reductions in overall psychiatric symptoms and tended to reduce maladaptive interpersonal sensitivity, anxiety, and frequency of unprotected receptive anal intercourse, while the cognitive-behavioral intervention resulted in less frequent illicit drug use during the follow-up period. Tests for clinical significance of change particularly underscored benefits of the social support group intervention both at postintervention and at long-term follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Brief group therapy for depressed persons with HIV infection produced reductions in symptoms of distress. The two forms of therapy resulted in shared and unique improvements in functioning, although social support groups focused on emotional coping presented greater evidence of clinically significant change.

Effectiveness of a Web-based guided self-help intervention for outpatients with a depressive disorder: Short-term results from a randomized controlled trial. Journal of medical Internet research, 18(3).",NA,"Background: Research has convincingly demonstrated that symptoms of depression can be reduced through guided Internet-based interventions. However, most of those studies recruited people form the general population. There is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness when delivered in routine clinical practice in outpatient clinics. Objective: The objective of this randomized controlled trial was to study patients with a depressive disorder (as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Disorders, fourth edition), as assessed by trained interviewers with the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, who registered for treatment at an outpatient mental health clinic. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of guided Internet-based self-help before starting face-to-face treatment. Methods: We recruited 269 outpatients, aged between 18 and 79 years, from outpatient clinics and randomly allocated them to Internet-based problem solving therapy (n = 136), with weekly student support, or to a control condition, who remained on the waitlist with a self-help booklet (control group; n = 133). Participants in both conditions were allowed to take up face-to-face treatment at the outpatient clinics afterward. We measured the primary outcome, depressive symptoms, by Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale (CES-D). Secondary outcome measures were the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale Anxiety subscale (HADS-A), Insomnia Severity Index questionnaire (ISI), and EuroQol visual analog scale (EQ-5D VAS). All outcomes were assessed by telephone at posttest (8 weeks after baseline). Results: Posttest measures were completed by 184 (68.4%) participants. We found a moderate to large within-group effect size for both the intervention (d = 0.75) and the control (d=0.69) group. However, the between-group effect size was very small (d = 0.07), and regression analysis on posttreatment CES-D scores revealed no significant differences between the groups (b = 1.134, 95% CI -2.495 to 4.763). The per-protocol analysis ( 4 sessions completed) results were also not significant (b = 1.154, 95% CI -1.978 to 7.637). Between-group differences were small and not significant for all secondary outcomes. Adherence to the intervention was low. Only 36% (49/136) received an adequate dosage of the intervention ( 4 of 5 sessions). The overall treatment satisfaction was moderate. Conclusions: Internet-based problem solving therapy is not more effective in reducing symptoms of depression than receiving an unguided self-help book during the waitlist period at outpatient mental health clinics. The effect sizes are much smaller than those found in earlier research in the general population, and the low rates of adherence indicate that the acceptability of the intervention at this stage of treatment for depressed outpatients is low. However, taking into account that there is much evidence for the efficacy of Internet-based treatments, it is too early to draw firm conclusions about the effectiveness of these treatments in outpatient clinics as a whole.

Health Technology Assessment. 2000;4(19):1-83.",NA,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine both the clinical and cost-effectiveness of usual general practitioner (GP) care compared with two types of brief psychological therapy (non-directive counselling and cognitive-behaviour therapy) in the management of depression as well as mixed anxiety and depression in the primary care setting. DESIGN: The design was principally a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, but was accompanied by two additional allocation methods allowing patient preference: the option of a specific choice of treatment (preference allocation) and the option to be randomised between the psychological therapies only. Of the 464 patients allocated to the three treatments, 197 were randomised between the three treatments, 137 chose a specific treatment, and 130 were randomised between the psychological therapies only. The patients underwent follow-up assessments at 4 and 12 months. SETTING: The study was conducted in 24 general practices in Greater Manchester and London. SUBJECTS: A total of 464 eligible patients, aged 18 years and over, were referred by 73 GPs and allocated to one of the psychological therapies or usual GP care for depressive symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions consisted of brief psychological therapy (12 sessions maximum) or usual GP care. Non-directive counselling was provided by counsellors who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Counselling. Cognitive-behaviour therapy was provided by clinical psychologists who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies. Usual GP care included discussions with patients and the prescription of medication, but GPs were asked to refrain from referring patients for psychological intervention for at least 4 months. Most therapy sessions took place on a weekly basis in the general practices. By the 12-month follow-up, GP care in some cases did include referral to mental healthcare specialists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical outcomes included depressive symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, social function and patient satisfaction. The economic outcomes included direct and indirect costs and quality of life. Assessments were carried out at baseline during face-to-face interviews as well as at 4 and 12 months in person or by post. RESULTS: At 4 months, both psychological therapies had reduced depressive symptoms to a significantly greater extent than usual GP care. Patients in the psychological therapy groups exhibited mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory that were 4-5 points lower than the mean score of patients in the usual GP care group, a difference that was also clinically significant. These differences did not generalize to other measures of outcome. There was no significant difference in outcome between the two psychological therapies when they were compared directly using all 260 patients randomised to a psychological therapy by either randomised allocation method. At 12 months, the patients in all three groups had improved to the same extent. The lack of a significant difference between the treatment groups at this point resulted from greater improvement of the patients in the GP care group between the 4- and 12-month follow-ups. At 4 months, patients in both psychological therapy groups were more satisfied with their treatment than those in the usual GP care group. However, by 12 months, patients who had received non-directive counselling were more satisfied than those in either of the other two groups. There were few differences in the baseline characteristics of patients who were randomised or expressed a treatment preference, and no differences in outcome between these patients. Similar outcomes were found for patients who chose either psychological therapy. Again, there were no significant differences between the two groups at 4 or 12 months.

DESIGN: The design was principally a pragmatic randomised controlled trial, but was accompanied by two additional allocation methods allowing patient preference: the option of a specific choice of treatment (preference allocation) and the option to be randomised between the psychological therapies only. Of the 464 patients allocated to the three treatments, 197 were randomised between the three treatments, 137 chose a specific treatment, and 130 were randomised between the psychological therapies only. The patients underwent follow-up assessments at 4 and 12 months. SETTING: The study was conducted in 24 general practices in Greater Manchester and London. SUBJECTS: A total of 464 eligible patients, aged 18 years and over, were referred by 73 GPs and allocated to one of the psychological therapies or usual GP care for depressive symptoms. INTERVENTIONS: The interventions consisted of brief psychological therapy (12 sessions maximum) or usual GP care. Non-directive counselling was provided by counsellors who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Counselling. Cognitive-behaviour therapy was provided by clinical psychologists who were qualified for accreditation by the British Association for Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapies. Usual GP care included discussions with patients and the prescription of medication, but GPs were asked to refrain from referring patients for psychological intervention for at least 4 months. Most therapy sessions took place on a weekly basis in the general practices. By the 12-month follow-up, GP care in some cases did include referral to mental healthcare specialists. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The clinical outcomes included depressive symptoms, general psychiatric symptoms, social function and patient satisfaction. The economic outcomes included direct and indirect costs and quality of life. Assessments were carried out at baseline during face-to-face interviews as well as at 4 and 12 months in person or by post. RESULTS: At 4 months, both psychological therapies had reduced depressive symptoms to a significantly greater extent than usual GP care. Patients in the psychological therapy groups exhibited mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory that were 4-5 points lower than the mean score of patients in the usual GP care group, a difference that was also clinically significant.

Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy (ICBT) is a treatment option supported in several trials, but there is as yet a lack of effective studies of ICBT in real world primary care settings. We examined whether ICBT differed from treatment-as-usual (TAU) in reducing depressive symptoms after 3 months. TAU comprised of visits to general practitioner, registered nurse, antidepressant drugs, waiting list for, or psychotherapy, or combinations of these alternatives. Patients, aged 18 years, who tentatively met criteria for mild to moderate depression at 16 primary care centers in the south-western region of Sweden were recruited and then assessed in a diagnostic interview. A total of 90 patients were randomized to either TAU or ICBT. The ICBT treatment included interactive elements online, a workbook, a CD with mindfulness and acceptance exercises, and minimal therapist contact. The treatment period lasted for 12 weeks after which both groups were assessed. The main outcome measure was Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). Additional measures were Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale self rating version (MADRS-S) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI). The analyses revealed no significant difference between the two groups at post treatment, neither on BDI-II, MADRS-S, nor BAI. Twenty patients (56%) in the ICBT treatment completed all seven modules. Our findings suggest that ICBT may be successfully delivered in primary care and that the effectiveness, after 3 months, is at par with TAU.

The current study assesses whether COMET is also an effective intervention for patients with depressive disorders. METHODS: Sixty-one patients with depressive disorders who were already in therapy in an outpatient mental health institution were randomly assigned to either eight group sessions of COMET in addition to their regular therapy (COMET + therapy as usual [TAU]: the experimental group) or to 8 weeks of ongoing regular therapy (TAU only: the control group). These latter (control) patients received COMET after their TAU only period. All patients in both groups that completed COMET were contacted 3 and 6 months later to assess whether the effects of COMET had remained stable. RESULTS: Compared to the patients who received TAU only, patients in the COMET + TAU condition showed significant improvement with large effect sizes on indices of self-esteem, depression, and depressive rumination. The therapeutic effects of COMET + TAU remained stable after 3 and 6 months on all outcome measures or improved even further.

Life review therapy was compared with care as usual. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms;secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, positive mental health, quality of life, and current major depressive episode (MDE). To identify groups for whom the intervention was particularly effective, moderator analyses were carried out (on sociodemographic variables, personality traits, reminiscence functions, clinically relevant depressive and anxiety symptoms, and past MDEs). RESULTS. Compared with care as usual (n=102), life review therapy (n=100) was effective in reducing depressive symptoms, at post-treatment (d=0.60, B= -5.3, p<0.001), at 3-month follow-up (d=0.50, B= -5.0, p<0.001) and for the intervention also at 9-month follow-up (t=5.7, p<0.001). The likelihood of a clinically significant change in depressive symptoms was significantly higher [odds ratio (OR) 3.77, p<0.001 at post-treatment ; OR 3.76, p<0.001 at the 3-month follow-up]. Small significant effects were found for symptoms of anxiety and positive mental health.Moderator analyses showed only two significant moderators, the personality trait of extraversion and the reminiscence function of boredom reduction.

The Depression in Elderly with Long-Term Afflictions (DELTA) study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a nurse-led minimal psychological intervention (MPI) in chronically ill elderly persons with depression. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted, comparing the MPI with usual care in 361 primary care patients. Four nurses had an average of 4 sessions with the intervention patients, each lasting 1 h, over a maximum period of 3 months. Patients were aged 60 years and older, had a minor depression or mild-to-moderate major depression, and either had type II diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. RESULTS: Nine months after the intervention, patients receiving the MPI had significantly fewer depressive symptoms; the intervention patients were also more likely than usual-care controls to show a >or=50% reduction in depressive symptoms relative to baseline values. At 9 months, diabetic MPI patients had a better quality of life than diabetic controls. CONCLUSIONS: The nurse-led MPI appears to be a feasible and moderately effective method of managing minor-to-moderate depression in chronically ill elderly persons. However, we cannot rule out attention-placebo effects, and the disappointing finding of a recent economic evaluation showing only a 63% chance of the MPI being cost-effective. From a clinical point of view, however, it is of interest to further evaluate adaptations of the MPI, with a stronger emphasis on detection, watchful waiting and mental health problems in general.","A minimal psychological intervention in chronically ill elderly patients with depression: a randomized trial",NA,"Psychother Psychosom","Lamers, 2010","Lamers_2010_msd_bdi-1_post_NA_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

We evaluated ego-integrity and rumination as mediators and assessed whether the effects of the intervention did not differ across middle-aged and older adults. Method: Effects of life-review (n = 58) were compared with a waiting list group (n = 58) and an expressive writing intervention (n = 58) on depressive symptoms (primary outcome), anxiety, and well-being (secondary outcomes). Mediator and moderator analyses were also applied. Results: Compared with the waiting list, life-review reduced depressive symptoms (d = 0.35) and enhanced emotional (d = 0.16) and psychological well-being (d = 0.27). Life-review was not more effective than expressive writing. The effects on depressive symptoms were partly related with increases in ego-integrity and decreases in rumination. The intervention is applicable for middle-aged and older adults. Conclusion: Life-review is effective as self-help for middle-aged and older adults with moderate depressive symptomatology compared with a waiting list group. Future research should investigate whether stimulating ego-integrity and reducing rumination enhance the effects of the intervention. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2015 APA, all rights reserved).

Feasibility study of a psychodynamic online group intervention for depression.

More recently it has become the psychodynamic protocol for depression specifically within Improving Access to Psychological Therapies services across the U.K. The aim of the present study was to pilot and evaluate the feasibility of a group online version of DITOnline Group Dynamic Interpersonal Therapyand the perceived helpfulness of psychodynamically informed self-help materials. Twenty-four participants were randomly assigned to three groups. Participants in Condition A (n = 8) took part in an online DIT group, with self-help materials, facilitated by a therapist. Participants in Condition B (n = 8) were given access to a closed virtual group space where they could interact with each other and were supplied with the same self-help materials used by participants in Condition A, but without online therapist facilitation. Participants in Condition C (n = 8) received no instructions or facilitation, but had access to an online mental well-being site where they could meet virtually in a large, open, moderated virtual group space to discuss their psychological difficulties. This feasibility study was underpowered to detect significant differences in rates of change between facilitated and unfacilitated provision of material, but decline in symptoms appeared to be superior to control only for the facilitated group when the groups were considered separately. The response of the combined treated groups against control suggests that the DIT self-help materials may be helpful and appear to support the process of change. Further work is required.

We conducted a randomized controlled trial comparing brief Interpersonal Psychotherapy (brief-IPT) to enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) for perinatal depression in low-income women. The brief-IPT model is designed to better engage low-income women by utilizing an engagement session, providing flexible delivery of sessions, and pragmatic case management. Methods Pregnant women, aged >18, between 12 and 30 weeks gestation were recruited from an urban prenatal clinic. Women scoring >10 on the Edinburgh Depression Scale and meeting depressive disorder criteria were randomized to either brief-IPT (n=21) or ETAU (n=21). We assessed treatment outcomes, acceptability, and feasibility of the intervention (measured by session attendance). Results Depression scores significantly decreased in both brief-IPT and ETAU. Brief-IPT participants reported significant improvements in social support satisfaction as compared to ETAU participants, even after controlling for concurrent depressive symptoms. Brief-IPT participants reported high satisfaction with the program. However, many participants did not participate in the full 9-session course of treatment (average sessions attended =6, range 0-17). Limitations Small sample size, use of self-report measures, and lack of an active psychotherapy control group limits interpretation of study results. Conclusions Brief-IPT for perinatal depression is acceptable to low-income women and is helpful for improving depressive symptoms and social support. However, feasibility of the treatment was limited by relatively low session attendance in spite of efforts to maximize treatment engagement. Additional modifications to meet the needs of low-income women are discussed.

Brief-IPT participants reported high satisfaction with the program. However, many participants did not participate in the full 9-session course of treatment (average sessions attended =6, range 0-17). Limitations Small sample size, use of self-report measures, and lack of an active psychotherapy control group limits interpretation of study results. Conclusions Brief-IPT for perinatal depression is acceptable to low-income women and is helpful for improving depressive symptoms and social support. However, feasibility of the treatment was limited by relatively low session attendance in spite of efforts to maximize treatment engagement. Additional modifications to meet the needs of low-income women are discussed.

Perinatal depression is a public health burden impacting mothers and their offspring. This study extended brief-Interpersonal Psychotherapy delivered during pregnancy by incorporating a postpartum attachment based dyadic-component to maintain mother's treatment gains and enhance the mother-infant relationship (called IPT-Dyad). The current report presents data from a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing IPT-Dyad to Enhanced Treatment as Usual (ETAU).





Methods


Women, ages 18 and older, between 12â30 weeks gestation meeting criteria for a depressive disorder were eligible. Participants were randomized to either IPT-Dyad (n = 21) or ETAU (n = 21). Maternal and infant outcomes were assessed through one-year postpartum.





Results


Participants were primarily African American (77%), single (80%), with low-incomes. Attrition was high in both groups (IPT-Dyad 30%; ETAU 40%). Depression scores improved from baseline in both groups and remained improved over the 12 month follow-up. There were no between group differences on measures of parenting stress, mother-infant interactions, and infant socioemotional functioning.





Limitations


The small sample size of this study was further reduced by attrition, despite efforts to maintain engagement. Reliance on self-report outcome measures is also a limitation.





Conclusions


IPT-Dyad may be a promising intervention for perinatal depression with potential benefit for mothers and babies. Treatment engagement and management of psychosocial needs were persistent challenges throughout the postpartum period. Further refinement of intervention content and schedule to better meet the needs and values of under-resourced mothers is needed. Earlier screening; better integration of care within OB settings; and delivering care in conjunction with social service resources may also improve outcomes.",NA,NA,NA,"Lenze, 2020","Lenze_2020_msd_epds_post_nr_self-report_ipt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Methods: A randomized clinical trial allocated an initial sample of 431 eligible employed adults (age 45) to a work-focused intervention (WFI) or usual care. Inclusion criteria were depression as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and at-work limitations indicated by a productivity loss score 5% on the Work Limitations Questionnaire (WLQ). Study sites included 19 employers and five related organizations. Telephone-based counseling provided three integrated modalities: care coordination, cognitive-behavioral therapy strategy development, and work coaching and modification. Effectiveness (change in productivity loss scores from preintervention to four months postintervention) was tested with mixed models adjusted for confounders. Secondary outcomes included change in WLQ work performance scales, self-reported absences, and depression. Results: Of 1,227 eligible employees (7% of screened), 431 (35%) enrolled and 380 completed the study (12% attrition).

The intervention group showed a non-significantly lower proportion of long-term sickness absence spells compared with the control group (p = 0.127). Statistically significant and clinically relevant differences in depressive complaints were found after both 6 months (p = 0.001) and 12 months (p = 0.005) of follow-up, in favour of the intervention group. Relative risk reductions (RRR) were 19.2% and 19.8% respectively. Sickness absence data were available for all participants over 18 months of follow-up. Questionnaire data were available for 99 (at 6 months) and 90 participants (at 12 months). No adverse events or side effects occurred.

However, depressed women are often excluded from weight loss trials. PURPOSE: This study examined treatment outcomes among women with comorbid obesity and depression. METHODS: Two hundred three (203) women were randomized to behavioral weight loss (n = 102) or behavioral weight loss combined with cognitive-behavioral depression management (n = 101). RESULTS: Average participant age was 52 years; mean baseline body mass index was 39 kg/m(2). Mean Patient Health Questionnaire and Hopkins Symptom Checklist (SCL-20) scores indicated moderate to severe baseline depression. Weight loss and SCL-20 changes did not differ between groups at 6 or 12 months in intent-to-treat analyses (p = 0.26 and 0.55 for weight, p = 0.70 and 0.25 for depressive symptoms). CONCLUSIONS: Depressed obese women lost weight and demonstrated improved mood in both treatment programs.

However, there is little consensus concerning the optimal form and delivery of this intervention. To develop acceptable and effective interventions, a phased process has been proposed, using a modeling phase to examine and develop an intervention prior to preliminary testing in an exploratory trial. This paper (a) describes the modeling phase used to develop a guided self-help intervention for depression in primary care and (b) reports data from an exploratory randomised trial of the intervention. Methods: A guided self-help intervention was developed following a modeling phase which involved a systematic review, meta synthesis and a consensus process. The intervention was then tested in an exploratory randomised controlled trial by examining (a) fidelity using analysis of taped guided self-help sessions (b) acceptability to patients and professionals through qualitative interviews (c) effectiveness through estimation of the intervention effect size. Results: Fifty eight patients were recruited to the exploratory trial. Seven professionals and nine patients were interviewed, and 22 tapes of sessions analysed for fidelity. Generally, fidelity to the intervention protocol was high, and the professionals delivered the majority of the specific components (with the exception of the use of feedback). Acceptability to both professionals and patients was also high. The effect size of the intervention on outcomes was small, and in line with previous analyses showing the modest effect of guided self-help in primary care. However, the sample size was small and confidence intervals around the effectiveness estimate were wide. Conclusion: The general principles of the modeling phase adopted in this study are designed to draw on a range of evidence, potentially providing an intervention that is evidence-based, patient centred and acceptable to professionals. However, the pilot outcome data did not suggest that the intervention developed was particularly effective. The advantages and disadvantages of the general methods used in the modeling phase are discussed, and possible reasons for the failure to demonstrate a larger effect in this particular case are outlined.

The effect of guided web-based cognitive behavioral therapy on patients with depressive symptoms and heart failure: A pilot randomized controlled trial. Journal of Medical Internet Research. 2016;18(8):e194.",NA,"Background: Depressive symptoms, and the associated coexistence of symptoms of anxiety and decreased quality of life (QoL), are a common problem in patients with heart failure (HF). However, treatment strategies for depressive symptoms in patients with HF still remain to be established. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and its Internet-based version as guided self-help CBT programs (ICBT) have shown good effects in the treatment of depression, but ICBT has not previously been evaluated in patients with HF and depressive symptoms. Objective: The aims of this study were to: (I) evaluate the effect of a nine-week ICBT program on depressive symptoms in patients with HF; (II) to assess factors associated with the change in depressive symptoms; and (III) to investigate the effect of the ICBT program on cardiac anxiety and QoL. Methods: Fifty participants were included and randomized into two treatment arms: ICBT or an online moderated discussion forum (DF). The Patient Health Questionnaire -9 (PHQ-9) was used to measure depressive symptoms, the Cardiac Anxiety Questionnaire (CAQ) was used to measure cardiac-related anxiety, and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure questionnaire (MLHF) was used to measure QoL. Data were collected at baseline and at the nine-week follow-up. Results: In the ICBT group, depressive symptoms (M=10.8 vs. M=8.6, P=.02) and cardiac anxiety in the subscale of fear (M=1.55 vs. M=1.35, P=.04) improved significantly. QoL improved in the ICBT group by 6 points in the total score and 2.4 points in the physical factor, but this was not significant (P=.09 and P=.12). In the DF group, only a small reduction in the level of depressive symptoms was detected (M =10.6 SD=5.0, vs. M=9.8 SD=4.3, P=.36). Despite improvement in the ICBT group this was not significantly different compared to the DF group (ANCOVA analyses: depressive symptoms, P=.21; cardiac-related anxiety subscale of fear, P=.22; QoL total scale score, P=.09 and physical factors, P=.07). In the ICBT group, the number of logins to the web-portal correlated significantly with improvement in depressive symptoms (P=.02), whereas higher age (P=.01) and male sex (P=.048) were associated with less change in depressive symptoms. Conclusions: Guided ICBT adapted for persons with HF and depressive symptoms can potentially reduce depressive symptoms, cardiac anxiety and increased QoL, but is not statistically superior to participation in an online discussion forum.","The effect of guided web-based cognitive behavioral therapy on patients with depressive symptoms and heart failure-a randomized controlled trial","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L72307156 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejhf.539 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=18790844&id=doi:10.1002%2Fejhf.539&atitle=The+effect+of+guided+web-based+cognitive+behavioral+therapy+on+patients+with+depressive+symptoms+and+heart+failure-a+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=Eur.+J.+Heart+Fail.&title=European+Journal+of+Heart+Failure&volume=18&issue=&spage=401&epage=&aulast=Johan+Lundgren&aufirst=J.&auinit=J.&aufull=Johan+Lundgren+J.&coden=&isbn=&pages=401-&date=2016&auinit1=J&auinitm=","European Journal of Heart Failure","Lundgren, 2016","Lundgren_2016_msd_phq-9_post_0_self-report_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA","A - Western"

Referrals to mental health professionals are frequently resisted by patients. The need for more effective treatment strategies led to the development and evaluation of a telephone-based, problem-solving intervention. METHODS: Patients in a family practice residency practice were evaluated through the Medical Outcomes Study Depression Screening Scale and the Diagnostic Interview Schedule to identify those with subthreshold or minor depression. Twenty-nine subjects were randomly assigned to either a treatment or comparison group. Initial scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were equivalent for the groups and were in the mildly depressed range. Six problem-solving therapy sessions were conducted over the telephone by graduate student therapists supervised by a psychiatrist. RESULTS: Treatment group subjects had significantly lower post-intervention scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale compared with their pre-intervention scores (P < .05). Scores did not differ significantly over time in the comparison group. Post-intervention, treatment group subjects also had lower Beck Depression Inventory scores than did the comparison group (P < .02), as well as more positive scores for social health (P < .002), mental health (P < .05), and self-esteem (P < .05) on the Duke Health Profile. CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that brief, telephone-based treatment for minor depression in family practice settings may be an efficient and effective method to decrease symptoms of depression and improve functioning. Nurses in these settings with appropriate training and supervision may also be able to provide this treatment.","Telephone counseling for patients with minor depression: preliminary findings in a family practice setting",NA,"J Fam Pract","Lynch, 1997","Lynch_1997_otherstatistic_hdrs_post_NA_clinician_pst_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

The British journal of psychiatry : the journal of mental science, 1-9. doi:10.1192/bjp.2019.53","10.1192/bjp.2019.53","BACKGROUND: Individuals with depression often do not respond to medication or psychotherapy. Radically open dialectical behaviour therapy (RO DBT) is a new treatment targeting overcontrolled personality, common in refractory depression.AimsTo compare RO DBT plus treatment as usual (TAU) for refractory depression with TAU alone (trial registration: ISRCTN 85784627). METHOD: RO DBT comprised 29 therapy sessions and 27 skills classes over 6 months. Our completed randomised trial evaluated RO DBT for refractory depression over 18 months in three British secondary care centres. Of 250 adult participants, we randomised 162 (65%) to RO DBT. The primary outcome was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), assessed masked and analysed by treatment allocated. RESULTS: After 7 months, immediately following therapy, RO DBT had significantly reduced depressive symptoms by 5.40 points on the HRSD relative to TAU (95% CI 0.94-9.85). After 12 months (primary end-point), the difference of 2.15 points on the HRSD in favour of RO DBT was not significant (95% CI -2.28 to 6.59); nor was that of 1.69 points on the HRSD at 18 months (95% CI -2.84 to 6.22). Throughout RO DBT participants reported significantly better psychological flexibility and emotional coping than controls. However, they reported eight possible serious adverse reactions compared with none in the control group. CONCLUSIONS: The RO DBT group reported significantly lower HRSD scores than the control group after 7 months, but not thereafter. The imbalance in serious adverse reactions was probably because of the controls' limited opportunities to report these.Declaration of interestSix of the 16 authors have received royalties or fees for RO DBT.

Coach-facilitated web-based therapy compared with information about web-based resources in patients referred to secondary mental health care for depression: Randomized controlled trial. Journal of Medical Internet Research. 2020;22(6).","10.2196/15001","Background: Depression is a common mental disorder with a high social burden and significant impact on suicidality and quality of life. Treatment is often limited to drug therapies because of long waiting times to see psychological therapists face to face, despite several guidelines recommending that psychological treatments should be first-line interventions for mild to moderate depression.


Objective: We aimed to evaluate, among patients on a waitlist to receive secondary mental health care services for depression, how effective coach-guided web-based therapy (The Journal) is, compared with an information-only waitlist control group, in reducing depression symptoms after 12 weeks.


Methods: We conducted a randomized controlled trial with 2 parallel arms and a process evaluation, which included interviews with study participants. Participants assigned to the intervention group received 12 weeks of web-based therapy guided by a coach who had a background in social work. Patients in the control group receive a leaflet of mental health resources they could access. The primary outcome measure was a change in depression scores, as measured by the Patient-Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).


Results: A total of 95 participants were enrolled (intervention, n=47; control, n=48). The mean change in PHQ-9 scores from baseline to week 12 was â3.6 (SD 6.6) in the intervention group and â3.1 (SD 6.2) in the control group, which was not a statistically significant difference with a two-sided alpha of .05 (t91=â0.37; P=.72, 95% CI â3.1 to 2.2). At 12 weeks, participants in the intervention group reported higher health-related quality of life (mean EuroQol 5 dimensions visual analogue scale [EQ-5D-VAS] score 66.8, SD 18.0) compared with the control group (mean EQ-5D VAS score 55.9, SD 19.2; t84=â2.73; P=.01). There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in health service use following their initial consultation with a psychiatrist. The process evaluation showed that participants in the intervention group completed a mean of 5.0 (SD 2.3) lessons in The Journal and 8.8 (SD 3.1) sessions with the coach. Most participants (29/47, 62%) in the intervention group who completed the full dose of the intervention, by finishing 6 or more lessons in The Journal, were more likely to have a clinically important reduction in depressive symptoms at 12 weeks compared with the control group (Î§21=6.3; P=.01, Î¦=0.37). Participants who completed the interviews reported that the role played by the coach was a major factor in adherence to the study intervention. Conclusions: The results demonstrate that the use of guided web-based therapy for the treatment of depression is not more effective than information-only waitlist control. However, it showed that the coach has the potential to increase adherence and engagement with web-based depression treatment protocols. Further research is needed on what makes the coach effective.",NA,NA,NA,"MacLean, 2020","MacLean_2020_msd_phq-9_post_12_self-report_otherpsy_otherctr_NA_NA","A - Western"

A 6-month follow-up was performed for patients treated with both psychotherapeutic approaches.

BMC Psychiatry, 17(1)","10.1186/s12888-017-1379-y","Background: Task shifting approaches (rational redistribution of tasks among health workforce teams) to train lay professionals to assist with integrating mental health treatment in primary care has been recommended to close the mental health treatment gap for depression in low- and middle-income countries. This study aims to examine the a new model for depression care in a low-resource environment compared to enhanced treatment at usual (E-TAU). Methods: We trained non-specialist community health workers (local lay employees of the public health system) to provide Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) to treat depressive symptoms in the Brazilian, Sao Paulo city, family health strategy (FHS). We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 86 patients with a current major depressive disorder or dysthymia (based on DSM-IV) recruited from an FHS clinic. Participants were randomized to IPC intervention (n=43) or E-TAU (n=43). Participants allocated to IPC received 3-4 sessions provided by community health workers; research psychologists followed the E-TAU participants to facilitate their referral to specialized mental health care within the public system. Reduction of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); minor psychiatric symptomatology (including depression, anxiety and somatoform symptoms) were measured using the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ); and functioning was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale over a 2-month period. Results: Intention-to-treat analysis showed significant improvement on symptoms for both groups over 2months, without significant differences between them. Per-protocol analysis showed significant better HDRS-17 outcomes for the IPC group.

Methods: We trained non-specialist community health workers (local lay employees of the public health system) to provide Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) to treat depressive symptoms in the Brazilian, Sao Paulo city, family health strategy (FHS). We conducted a randomized controlled trial involving 86 patients with a current major depressive disorder or dysthymia (based on DSM-IV) recruited from an FHS clinic. Participants were randomized to IPC intervention (n=43) or E-TAU (n=43). Participants allocated to IPC received 3-4 sessions provided by community health workers; research psychologists followed the E-TAU participants to facilitate their referral to specialized mental health care within the public system. Reduction of depressive symptoms was assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale (HDRS-17) and the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9); minor psychiatric symptomatology (including depression, anxiety and somatoform symptoms) were measured using the Self Reporting Questionnaire (SRQ); and functioning was measured by the Clinical Global Impression Scale over a 2-month period.

Method: One hundred and six patients with a current DSM-IV defined major depressive episode and persistent depressive symptoms for more than 2 years were randomized to TAU only (N = 35), or to TAU with additional 8-week group therapy of either 8 sessions of MBCT (n = 36) or CBASP (n = 35). The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (24-item HAM-D, Hamilton, 1967) at the end of treatment. Secondary outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996) and measures of social functioning and quality of life.

We aimed to evaluate comparative management of (PND) following screening with the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, using three best-practice care pathways by comparing management by general practitioners (GPs) alone compared to adjunctive counselling, based on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), delivered by postnatal nurses or psychologists. METHODS: This was a parallel, three-group randomised controlled trial conducted in a primary care setting (general practices and maternal & child health centres) and a psychology clinic. A total of 3,531 postnatal women were screened for symptoms of depression; 333 scored above cut-off on the screening tool and 169 were referred to the study. Sixty-eight of these women were randomised between the three treatment groups. RESULTS: Mean scores on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) at entry were in the moderate-to-severe range. There was significant variation in the post-study frequency of scores exceeding the threshold indicative of mild-to-severe depressive symptoms, such that more women receiving only GP management remained above the cut-off score after treatment (p = .028). However, all three treatment conditions were accompanied by significant reductions in depressive symptoms and mean post-study BDI-II scores were similar between groups. Compliance was high in all three groups. Women rated the treatments as highly effective. Rates of both referral to the study (51%), and subsequent treatment uptake (40%) were low.

Despite this, there is a paucity of research on intervention programmes designed to address depression and anxiety, and none that include infant outcomes. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a brief treatment for maternal depression and anxiety in pregnancy in a sample of women with a diagnosed depressive disorder. We developed a cognitive behavioural therapy treatment for antenatal depression and anxiety and evaluated it in a feasibility trial. This was followed by a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) which collected data on the efficacy of the brief intervention and follow-up data on infants. The feasibility study (n = 25) yielded promising results for adherence, acceptability and improvements in depression and anxiety (Beck Depression Inventory and Beck Anxiety Inventory). The RCT (n = 54) again showed excellent adherence and acceptability and supported the efficacy of the treatment. Strong reductions in anxiety were observed during pregnancy, and improvements in depression were maintained at 9 months representing a moderately large effect size. Nine-month infant outcomes showed several medium to large effects favouring the intervention in domains including problem solving, self-regulation and stress reactivity, which were independent of maternal postnatal mood. Treating severe depression and anxiety during pregnancy with a brief cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention appears feasible and worthwhile. To reliably detect clinically meaningful effects on infant outcomes, larger RCTs are likely to be required.","Feasibility study and pilot randomised trial of an antenatal depression treatment with infant follow-up","http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/53/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00737-015-0512-5.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00737-015-0512-5&token2=exp=1452255700~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F53%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00737-015-0512-5.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00737-015-0512-5*~hmac=6090118701555c041f761df21db33dc11df030c8d04e12c525b869f0a5737056","Arch Womens Ment Health","Milgrom, 2015b","Milgrom_2015b_msd_bdi-2_post_NA_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Archives of Women's Mental Health. 2020;23(2):293-294.","10.2196/jmir.4993","Background:


There are few published controlled trials examining the efficacy of Internet-based treatment for postnatal depression (PND) and none that assess diagnostic status (clinical remission) as the primary outcome. This is despite the need to improve treatment uptake and accessibility because fewer than 50% of postnatally depressed women seek help, even when identified as depressed.





Objective:


In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to test the efficacy of a 6-session Internet intervention (the MumMoodBooster program, previously evaluated in a feasibility trial) in a sample of postnatal women with a clinical diagnosis of depression. The MumMoodBooster program is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention, is highly interactive, includes a partner website, and was supported by low-intensity telephone coaching.





Methods:


This was a parallel 2-group RCT (N=43) comparing the Internet CBT treatment (n=21) to treatment as usual (n=22). At baseline and at 12 weeks after enrollment, womenâs diagnostic status was assessed by telephone with the Standardized Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) and symptom severity with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Depression symptoms were measured repeatedly throughout the study period with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).





Results:


At the end of the study, 79% (15/19) of women who received the Internet CBT treatment no longer met diagnostic criteria for depression on the SCID-IV (these outcome data were missing for 2 intervention participants). This contrasted with only 18% (4/22) remission in the treatment as usual condition. Depression scores on the BDI-II showed a large effect favoring the intervention group (d=.83, 95% CI 0.20-1.45). Small to medium effects were found on the PHQ-9 and on measures of anxiety and stress. Adherence to the program was very good with 86% (18/21) of users completing all sessions; satisfaction with the program was rated 3.1 out of 4 on average.





Conclusions:


Our results suggest that our Internet CBT program, MumMoodBooster, is an effective treatment option for women clinically diagnosed with PND. This is one of only two controlled evaluations of specialized online psychological treatment among women clinically diagnosed with PND. MumMoodBooster appears to be a feasible, effective treatment option, which is potentially accessible to large numbers of women in metropolitan, rural, and remote areas.

Internet cognitive behavioral therapy for women with postnatal depression: A randomized controlled trial of MumMoodBooster. Journal of Medical Internet Research. 2016;18(3):e54.","10.2196/jmir.4993","BACKGROUND: There are few published controlled trials examining the efficacy of Internet-based treatment for postnatal depression (PND) and none that assess diagnostic status (clinical remission) as the primary outcome. This is despite the need to improve treatment uptake and accessibility because fewer than 50% of postnatally depressed women seek help, even when identified as depressed. OBJECTIVE: In a randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aimed to test the efficacy of a 6-session Internet intervention (the MumMoodBooster program, previously evaluated in a feasibility trial) in a sample of postnatal women with a clinical diagnosis of depression. The MumMoodBooster program is a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention, is highly interactive, includes a partner website, and was supported by low-intensity telephone coaching. METHODS: This was a parallel 2-group RCT (N=43) comparing the Internet CBT treatment (n=21) to treatment as usual (n=22). At baseline and at 12 weeks after enrollment, women's diagnostic status was assessed by telephone with the Standardized Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID-IV) and symptom severity with the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). Depression symptoms were measured repeatedly throughout the study period with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). RESULTS: At the end of the study, 79% (15/19) of women who received the Internet CBT treatment no longer met diagnostic criteria for depression on the SCID-IV (these outcome data were missing for 2 intervention participants). This contrasted with only 18% (4/22) remission in the treatment as usual condition. Depression scores on the BDI-II showed a large effect favoring the intervention group (d=.83, 95% CI 0.20-1.45). Small to medium effects were found on the PHQ-9 and on measures of anxiety and stress. Adherence to the program was very good with 86% (18/21) of users completing all sessions; satisfaction with the program was rated 3.1 out of 4 on average. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that our Internet CBT program, MumMoodBooster, is an effective treatment option for women clinically diagnosed with PND. This is one of only two controlled evaluations of specialized online psychological treatment among women clinically diagnosed with PND. MumMoodBooster appears to be a feasible, effective treatment option, which is potentially accessible to large numbers of women in metropolitan, rural, and remote areas. Future work might be focused profitably on establishing comparability with face-to-face treatments and purely self-guided delivery. We have commenced a larger RCT comparing MumMoodBooster with face-to-face CBT.

Barriers to treatment include time constraints, demands of child care, and finances. A method for improving access to treatment of depression may be delivery of psychotherapy over the telephone. A 12-week pilot controlled clinical trial with random assignment was conducted to test the feasibility and efficacy of Interpersonal Psychotherapy delivered over the telephone (IPT-T) for depression in women (N=15 IPT-T and N=15 no treatment) with a life-time history of recurrent depression and low rates of previous treatment. Patients were interviewed at baseline and at 12 weeks by a blind and independent clinical evaluator to assess their symptom level and social functioning. IPT-T as compared to no treatment was significantly better in lowering symptoms of depression as measured by the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (p<.02), improving global functioning (GAS) (p<.02), and improving work and social functioning (p<.03-.05, respectively). These preliminary findings support the feasibility and helpfulness of IPT-T in preventing an increase in depressive symptoms among women with recurrent depression but current mild to moderately levels of depression.","Interpersonal psychotherapy delivered over the telephone to recurrent depressives.

Little is known about the effectiveness of guideline-based care for depression with impoverished minority women, most of whom do not seek care. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of an intervention to deliver guideline-based care for depression compared with referral to community care with low-income and minority women. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A randomized controlled trial conducted in the Washington, DC, suburban area from March 1997 through May 2002 of 267 women with current major depression, who attended county-run Women, Infants, and Children food subsidy programs and Title X family planning clinics. Outcomes Hamilton Depression Rating Scale measured monthly from baseline through 6 months; instrumental role functioning (Social Adjustment Scale) and social functioning (Short Form 36-Item Health Survey) measured at baseline and 3 and 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to an antidepressant medication intervention (trial of paroxetine switched to buproprion, if lack of response) (n = 88), a psychotherapy intervention (8 weeks of manual-guided cognitive behavior therapy) (n = 90), or referral to community mental health services (n = 89). RESULTS: Both the medication intervention (P<.001) and the psychotherapy intervention (P =.006) reduced depressive symptoms more than the community referral did. The medication intervention also resulted in improved instrumental role (P =.006) and social (P =.001) functioning. The psychotherapy intervention resulted in improved social functioning (P =.02). Women randomly assigned to receive medications were twice as likely (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% confidence interval, 0.98-4.27; P =.057) to achieve a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score of 7 or less by month 6 as were those referred to community care. CONCLUSIONS: Guideline-concordant care for major depression is effective for these ethnically diverse and impoverished patients. More women engaged in a sufficient duration of treatment with medications compared with psychotherapy, and outcome gains were more extensive and robust for medications.","Treating depression in predominantly low-income young minority women: a randomized controlled trial","http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/4886/JOC30289.pdf","Jama","Miranda, 2003","Miranda_2003_msd_hdrs_post_NA_clinician_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Cognitive bibliotherapy is a promising approach, but further research is necessary in order to assess its clinical efficacy and key mechanisms of change. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the efficacy of bibliotherapy for subthreshold depression and test whether maladaptive cognitions mediate the effects of bibliotherapy on depressive symptoms. METHOD: A total of 96 young adults with subthreshold depression were randomized in one of the following treatment conditions: immediate treatment, delayed treatment, placebo and no treatment. The main outcome was represented by depressive symptoms assessed before, during and immediately after the treatment, as well as at 3-month follow-up. Automatic thoughts, dysfunctional attitudes and irrational beliefs were also assessed throughout the study, and we investigated their involvement as mediators of bibliotherapy effects on depressive symptoms. RESULTS: The results indicated that cognitive bibliotherapy resulted in statistically and clinically significant changes both in depressive symptoms and cognitions, which were maintained at follow-up. In contrast, placebo was only associated with a temporary decrease in depressive symptoms, without significant cognitive changes. No changes in symptoms or cognitions were found in the delayed treatment and no treatment groups. We also found that automatic thoughts significantly mediated the effect of bibliotherapy on depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: This study provided compelling evidence for the efficacy of cognitive bibliotherapy in subthreshold depression and showed that changes in automatic thoughts mediated the effect of bibliotherapy on depressive symptoms. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGE: Cognitive bibliotherapy is an effective treatment of subthreshold depression. Changing automatic thoughts is important, as they mediate the bibliotherapy effect on depressive symptoms. Cognitive bibliotherapy is a potential alternative or adjunct to psychotherapy for mildly depressed adults.","Cognitive bibliotherapy for mild depressive symptomatology: randomized clinical trial of efficacy and mechanisms of change","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1002/cpp.1814/asset/cpp1814.pdf?v=1&t=iejv18tx&s=8d51e6f24b02074c1450022a6d3d28d8a9413907","Clin Psychol Psychother","Moldovan, 2013","Moldovan_2013_otherdich(RCI+cut-off)_bdi-ii_post_3months_self-report_cbt_wl_cbt(cognitivebibliotherapy)_wl","A - Western"

Effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention, interpersonal counseling, for subdysthymic depression in medically ill elderly. The journals of gerontology Series A, Biological sciences and medical sciences. 1996;51(4):M172-8.",NA,"BACKGROUND: Subdysthymic depression occurs in 20-50% of hospitalized elderly and is associated with physical and social disability, delayed recovery, and excess health service use. Despite this, little is known regarding the nature of such depressive symptomatology, or its responsivity to treatment. To address this, a randomized clinical trial assessing the feasibility and efficacy of Interpersonal Counseling (IPC), a short-term psychotherapy, was conducted. METHODS: Patients 60+ with a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score > 10 not meeting DSM-III-R criteria for major depression or dysthymia were recruited from the acute hospital. Thirty-five individuals were randomized to IPC and 41 to usual care (UC). IPC was delivered following hospital discharge by psychiatric clinical nurse specialists. Interviews were conducted at recruitment and 3, 6, and 12 months later. Primary outcomes were GDS scores, health ratings, and measures of physical and social functioning. RESULTS: At 3 months, IPC group members showed greater improvement than UC members on all outcome variables; between-group differences did not reach statistical significance. At 6 months, a statistically significant difference in the rate of improvement in GDS, indicated by scores of 10 or less, was observed for IPC compared to UC members (60.6% vs 35.1%). Multivariate analyses confirmed a positive treatment effect on depressive symptoms. Similar multivariate analyses showed a statistically significant positive treatment effect on self-rated health but not on physical or social functioning. CONCLUSIONS: IPC appears feasible, acceptable, and effective in short-term depressive symptom reduction and in improvement in self-rated health. Implementation of IPC interventions for subdysthymic hospitalized elderly is recommended.","Effectiveness of a psychosocial intervention, interpersonal counseling, for subdysthymic depression in medically ill elderly",NA,"J Gerontol A Biol Sci Med Sci","Mossey, 1996","Mossey_1996_remission(cut-off)_gds_post_NA_self-report_ipt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

This study compared outcomes on such variables as depressive symptoms, marital adjustment, social support and mother-infant bond at baseline, mid-treatment, end-of-treatment and 3 months follow-up. Participants were also independently assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). 50 women completed baseline assessments and were included in the analysis. Comparisons of treatment conditions showed that by end of treatment both the TAU and IPT-G groups significantly improved in terms of mean depression scores, however, the IPT-G women improved significantly more and had continued improvements at 3 months post therapy. Furthermore, women who received IPT-G displayed significant improvement in terms of marital functioning and perceptions of the mother-infant relationship compared to TAU participants.

Methods: This was an assessor-blinded, randomised controlled clinical trial. Particpants with a diagnosis of depression, attending psychiatry departments of three teaching hospitals in Lahore, Pakistan, were included in the study. We screened a total of 280 patients and randomly allocated 137 of them to CaCBT plus Treatment As Usual (TAU) [Treatment group] or to TAU alone [Control group]. Assessments were completed at baseline, at 3 months and at 9 months after baseline. Reduction in depression score (Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Depression Subscale) at 3 months was primary outcome measure. The secondary outcome measures included anxiety scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression-Anxiety Subscale), somatic symptoms (Bradford Somatic Inventory), disability (Brief Disability Questionnaire) and satisfaction with the treatment. Findings: A total of 69 participants were randomised to Treatment group and 68 to Control group. Participants in Treatment group showed statistically significant improvement in depression (p=0.000), anxiety (p=0.000), somatic symptoms (p=0.005) and disability (p=0.000). This effect was sustained at 9 months after baseline (Except for disability). Participants in Treatment group also reported higher satisfaction with treatment compared with those in Control group. Conclusion: Brief CaCBT can be effective in improving depressive symptoms, when compared with treatment as usual. This is the first report of a trial of Culturally adapted CBT from South Asia and further studies are needed to generalise these findings.","Brief Culturally adapted CBT (CaCBT) for depression: A randomized controlled trial from Pakistan","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/587/CN-01069587/frame.html and http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0165032715000889/1-s2.0-S0165032715000889-main.pdf?_tid=040e5468-b60c-11e5-bea6-00000aacb35f&acdnat=1452260023_535218dcbdfb1a4fa55734d41acdd953","Journal of affective disorders","Naeem, 2015","Naeem_2015_msd_hads-d_post_NA_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

Methods: A 16-week assessor-masked randomized controlled trial with a 12-month follow-up was conducted in 1 university hospital and 1 psychiatric hospital from September 2008 to December 2014. Outpatients aged 20-65 years with pharmacotherapy-resistant depression (taking antidepressant medications for 8 weeks, 17-item GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [GRID-HDRS17] score 16, Maudsley Staging Method for treatment-resistant depression score 3, and DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT combined with TAU or to TAU alone. The primary outcome was the alleviation of depressive symptoms, as measured by change in the total GRID-HDRS17 score from baseline to 16 weeks; primary analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: A total of 80 patients were randomized; 78 (97.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome, and 73 (91.3%) were followed up for 12 months.

Outpatients aged 20-65 years with pharmacotherapy-resistant depression (taking antidepressant medications for 8 weeks, 17-item GRID-Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [GRID-HDRS17] score 16, Maudsley Staging Method for treatment-resistant depression score 3, and DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder) were randomly assigned (1:1) to CBT combined with TAU or to TAU alone. The primary outcome was the alleviation of depressive symptoms, as measured by change in the total GRID-HDRS17 score from baseline to 16 weeks; primary analysis was done on an intention-to-treat basis. Results: A total of 80 patients were randomized; 78 (97.5%) were assessed for the primary outcome, and 73 (91.3%) were followed up for 12 months. Supplementary CBT significantly alleviated depressive symptoms at 16 weeks, as shown by greater least squares mean changes in GRID-HDRS17 scores in the intervention group than in the control group (-12.7 vs -7.4; difference = -5.4; 95% CI, -8.1 to -2.6; P <.001), and the treatment effect was maintained for at least 12 months (-15.4 vs -11.0; difference = -4.4; 95% CI, -7.2 to -1.6; P =.002). Conclusions: Patients with pharmacotherapy-resistant depression treated in psychiatric specialty care settings may benefit from supplementing usual medication management with CBT.","Effectiveness of supplementary cognitive-behavioral therapy for pharmacotherapy-resistant depression: A randomized controlled trial","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L619051183 and http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/JCP.15m10511 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=01606689&id=doi:10.4088%2FJCP.15m10511&atitle=Effectiveness+of+supplementary+cognitive-behavioral+therapy+for+pharmacotherapy-resistant+depression%3A+A+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=J.+Clin.+Psychiatry&title=Journal+of+Clinical+Psychiatry&volume=78&issue=8&spage=1126&epage=1135&aulast=Nakagawa&aufirst=Atsuo&auinit=A.&aufull=Nakagawa+A.&coden=JCLPD&isbn=&pages=1126-1135&date=2017&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Journal of Clinical Psychiatry","Nakagawa, 2017","Nakagawa_2017_msd_qids-sr_post_NA_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

We compared GSP with group HIV education (GHE) for treatment of depression in people with HIV in Uganda. METHODS: In this open-label randomised controlled trial, we included men and women with HIV, aged 19 years or older, who met the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview criteria for major depression from an urban HIV care centre in Kitgum district, northern Uganda. Participants were randomly assigned to receive eight weekly sessions of either GSP or GHE. Randomisation was achieved by urn (men and women separately picked a paper containing the intervention allocation from a basket; ratio 1:1), and the intervention sessions were given to gender-specific groups. Participants were followed up immediately after the intervention and 6 months after the end of treatment. The primary outcomes were change in depressive symptom scores (measured with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire) and in function scores (measured with a locally developed method), analysed by intention to treat using cluster-adjusted t tests and permutation tests. This trial is registered with The Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, number PACTR201402000742370. FINDINGS: Between Jan 6, and Jan 20, 2014, we assessed 150 individuals, of whom 109 were randomly assigned to receive eight weekly sessions of either GSP (n=57) or GHE (n=52). Change in mean depression scores immediately after intervention did not differ between groups (mean difference -0.19, 95% CI -1.77 to 1.39, p=0.78). Mean function scores did not differ between groups either (0.24, -0.41 to 0.88; p=0.41). At 6 months after end of treatment, participants in the GSP group had lower mean depression scores than did those in the GHE group (-2.50, -3.98 to 1.02, p value=0.005), and higher function scores (0.74, -0.17 to 1.65, p=0.09) than did participants in the GHE group. No adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: The benefits of existing HIV educational interventions in HIV care services could be improved by the addition of GSP content. Potential benefits of the integration of GSP into existing HIV interventions, such as adherence counselling or group HIV educational programmes, should be addressed in future studies.

WHO recommends the use of psychological interventions as first-line treatment for depression in low-income and middle-income countries. However, evaluations of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of such interventions among people with HIV are scarce. Our aim was to establish the effectiveness of group support psychotherapy (GSP) delivered by lay health workers for depression treatment among people living with HIV in a rural area of Uganda on a large scale.





Methods


In this cluster-randomised trial, we included 30 health centres offering HIV care. These were randomly assigned to deliver either GSP or group HIV education (GHE). Randomisation, in a ratio of 1:1, was achieved by health centre managers separately picking a paper containing the intervention allocation from a basket. Participants were people living with HIV, aged 19 years and older, with mild to moderate major depression assessed with the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview depression module, taking antiretroviral therapy, and antidepressant-naive. Group sessions were led by trained lay health workers once a week for 8 weeks. The primary outcomes were the proportion of participants with major depression and function scores at 6 months post-treatment, analysed by intention to treat by means of multilevel random effect regression analyses adjusting for clustering in health centres. This trial is registered with the Pan African Clinical Trials Registry, PACTR201608001738234.





Findings


Between Sept 13 and Dec 15, 2016, we assessed 1473 individuals, of whom 1140 were recruited from health centres offering GSP (n=578 [51%]) or GHE (n=562 [49%]). Two (<1%) participants in the GSP group were diagnosed with major depression 6 months post-treatment compared with 160 (28%) in the GHE group (adjusted odds ratio=0Â·01, 95% CI 0Â·003â0Â·012, p<0Â·0001). The mean function scores 6 months post-treatment were 9Â·85 (SD 0Â·76) in the GSP group and 6Â·83 (2Â·85) in the GHE group (Î²=4Â·12; 95% CI 3Â·75â4Â·49, p<0Â·0001). 36 individuals had 63 serious adverse events, which included 25 suicide attempts and 22 hospital admissions for medical complications. The outcomes of these serious adverse events included 16 deaths, 4 of which were completed suicides (GSP=2; GHE=2), and 12 of which were HIV-related medical complications (GSP=8; GHE=4). Cost-effectiveness estimates showed an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$13Â·0 per disability-adjusted life-year averted, which can be considered very cost-effective in Uganda.





Interpretation


Integration of cost-effective psychological treatments such as group support psychotherapy into existing HIV interventions might improve the mental health of people living with HIV.",NA,NA,NA,"Nakimuli-Mpungu, 2020","Nakimuli-Mpungu_2020_remission(diag)_mini_post_24_clinician_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

However, as yet, little research has examined the cognitive effects of these interventions. AIMS: This study investigated the impact of a single session of BA on depressive symptomatology, self-reported avoidance, and behavioural approach and avoidance tendencies. METHOD: Forty-six patients with a diagnosis of Major Depression were recruited from primary care psychological therapies services and block randomized to either a single session of behavioural activation (n = 22) or waiting list control (n = 24) delivered by an unblinded therapist. Self-reports of symptoms and cognitive factors were assessed before and after the one-week intervention phase. Approach and avoidance behavioural tendencies were assessed using the Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT). RESULTS: Data from 40 participants (n = 20 in each group) was available for analyses. Depressive symptoms significantly decreased, and activation significantly increased from before to after treatment in the treatment group, but not in the control group. Performance on the AAT showed a trend indicating increased approach to positive valence stimuli in the treatment group, but not in the control group. Mediational analyses indicated small indirect effects of self-reported change in activation as mediators of the effect of condition on symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a single session of BA can have significant effects on symptoms in clinically depressed patients. Results hint at the possibility that increased behavioural approach might mediate the effect of BA.","Effects of Brief Behavioural Activation on Approach and Avoidance Tendencies in Acute Depression: preliminary Findings","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/905/CN-01331905/frame.html and https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/937187B4C4F92AFC36287805FA1FC33E/S1352465816000394a.pdf/div-class-title-effects-of-brief-behavioural-activation-on-approach-and-avoidance-tendencies-in-acute-depression-preliminary-findings-div.pdf","Behavioural and cognitive psychotherapy","Nasrin, 2017","Nasrin_2017_msd_phq-9_post_NA_self-report_bat_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

We examined whether Interpersonal Counseling (IPC) was superior to treatment as usual (TAU) in reducing subsyndromal depression among miscarrying women and, secondarily, superior to TAU in improving role functioning. METHOD: Nineteen of 20 eligible women participated in a randomized controlled trial of 1 to 6 weekly telephone sessions of IPC versus TAU, which consisted of whatever lay counseling or professional care women sought on their own initiative, from October 2001 to April 2002. The 2 trial arms were compared on mean within-subject change in Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17-item (HAM-D-17) scores and in role functioning scale scores (a 5-item modification of the 36-item Medical Outcomes Study questionnaire) from baseline to post-intervention. RESULTS: In the primary intent-to-treat analysis, the baseline mean HAM-D-17 scores were 18.0 (SD +/- 8.4) and 14.8 (SD +/- 6.6) in the IPC (N = 10) and TAU (N = 9) arms, respectively; post-intervention, the corresponding means were 11.6 (SD +/- 8.2) and 12.9 (SD +/- 8.3). The mean within-subject decline in HAM-D-17 scores was significantly greater in the IPC (6.4) than in the TAU (1.9) arm (difference in mean within-subject score decline, adjusted for design features, baseline HAM-D-17 scores and for baseline ethnic imbalance between study arms, 6.2 [95% CI = 0.4 to 12.0]). In a subordinate completers' analysis (N = 15), the corresponding mean decline and difference in adjusted mean decline were 8.0, 2.4, and 6.7 (95% CI = 0.4 to 13.1), respectively. Treatment was unrelated to improved role functioning. CONCLUSION: The efficacy of telephone-administered IPC for subsyndromal depression after miscarriage warrants testing in a full-scale randomized controlled trial.","Pilot randomized controlled trial of interpersonal counseling for subsyndromal depression following miscarriage",NA,"J Clin Psychiatry","Neugebauer, 2006","Neugebauer_2006_msd_hdrs_post_NA_clinician_ipt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the efficacy of a generic 6-lesson iCBT delivered over 10 weeks in people with major depressive disorder (MDD) and DM. METHODS: Participants with comorbid MDD and DM (type 1 or 2) were recruited online and randomized to an iCBT program with therapist support provided by phone and email (n=42) or a treatment as usual (TAU, n=49) control group. Outcomes were assessed through Web-based self-report questionnaires and the trial was Web-based with no face-to-face components. Primary outcomes were self-reported depression (patient health questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), diabetes-related distress (problem areas in diabetes, PAID), and self-reported glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c).

Journal of medical Internet research, 19(5), e157.","10.2196/jmir.7274","BACKGROUND: Depression is twice as common in diabetes mellitus (DM) as the general population and is associated with adverse health outcomes, but access to evidence-based therapies such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is limited in routine diabetes care. Past research has shown that generic Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) is an effective treatment for depression in the general population, but it has never been evaluated in people with comorbid depression and DM. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to examine the efficacy of a generic 6-lesson iCBT delivered over 10 weeks in people with major depressive disorder (MDD) and DM. METHODS: Participants with comorbid MDD and DM (type 1 or 2) were recruited online and randomized to an iCBT program with therapist support provided by phone and email (n=42) or a treatment as usual (TAU, n=49) control group. Outcomes were assessed through Web-based self-report questionnaires and the trial was Web-based with no face-to-face components. Primary outcomes were self-reported depression (patient health questionnaire-9, PHQ-9), diabetes-related distress (problem areas in diabetes, PAID), and self-reported glycemic control (hemoglobin A1c, HbA1c). Secondary outcomes were general distress (Kessler 10-item psychological distress scale, K-10) and disability (short form 12-item, SF-12), generalized anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder 7-item, GAD-7), and somatization (PHQ-15). The iCBT group was assessed at 3 months. RESULTS: A total of 27 participants (66%; 27/41) completed the iCBT program. Analyses indicated between-group superiority of iCBT over TAU at posttreatment on PHQ-9 (g=0.78), PAID (g=0.80), K-10 (g=1.06), GAD-7 (g=0.72), and SF-12 mental well-being scores (g=0.66), but no significant differences in self-reported HbA1c levels (g=0.14), SF-12 physical well-being, or PHQ-15 scores (g=0.03-0.21). Gains were maintained at 3-month follow-up in the iCBT group, and the 87% (27/31) of iCBT participants who were interviewed no longer met criteria for MDD. Clinically significant change following iCBT on PHQ-9 scores was 51% (21/41) versus 18% (9/49) in TAU. CONCLUSIONS: iCBT for depression is an efficacious, accessible treatment option for people with diabetes. Future studies should explore whether tailoring of iCBT programs improves acceptability and adherence, and evaluate the long-term outcomes following iCBT.

However, few studies have evaluated the effect of CBT delivered via telephone for newborn mothers. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of telephone-based CBT for postnatal depression at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Methods: A multisite randomized controlled trial was conducted in the postnatal units at 3 regional hospitals in Hong Kong. A total of 397 women with an Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score >10 on the second or third day postpartum were randomized to receive telephone-based CBT (n = 197) or standard care (n = 200). Primary outcome was the total EPDS score. A cutoff score of 9/10 on the EPDS was used to define women at risk of postnatal depression. Results: Telephone-based CBT was associated with significantly lower depressive symptoms compared with standard care, when assessed at 6 weeks postpartum in the subgroups of mothers with minor depression (EPDS 10-12; difference = 1.90, 95% CI: 0.72-3.08; p = 0.002) and major depression (EPDS >13; difference = 5.00, 95% CI: 3.12-6.88; p < 0.001). The effect was sustained at 6 months postpartum in the subgroup with minor depression (difference = 1.20, 95% CI: 0.09-2.32; p = 0.034) but not significant in the subgroup with major depression (difference = 1.69, 95% CI: -0.10-3.47; p = 0.064). The proportion of women who satisfied our definition of postnatal depression was significantly lower in the intervention group at 6 weeks (difference = 23.3%, 95% CI: 13.7-33.0%; p < 0.001) and 6 months postpartum (difference = 11.4%, 95% CI: 1.9-20.8%; p = 0.019). Conclusions: Telephone-based CBT produced a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms than standard care during the postpartum period.","The Effect of Telephone-Based Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy on Postnatal Depression: A Randomized Controlled Trial","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/388/CN-01096388/frame.html and http://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/430449","Psychotherapy and psychosomatics","Ngai, 2015 - minor depression","Ngai_2015_msd_epds_post_6monthspostpartum_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Methods: A total of 27 individuals with MDD (mean age = 43 years, 48% males) were randomly assigned either to eight weekly group sessions of W-IPT or to the TAU condition.

Results: Symptoms of depression in experts' ratings as well as in self-rated ratings decreased over time, but more so in the W-IPT condition compared to the TAU condition [experts rating: large effect size (d = 1.25) and self-assessment: large effect sizes (d = 0.94)].

The purpose of this study was to compare two interventions for depression, problem solving treatment (PST) and referral to the patients physician, with a waiting-list control group in people with sight loss and depressive symptoms. METHODS. This was an assessor-masked, exploratory, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, with concurrent economic analysis. Of 1008 consecutive attendees at 14 low-vision rehabilitation centers in Britain, 43% (n 430) screened positive for depressive symptoms on the Geriatric Depression Scale and 85 of these attendees participated in the trial. Eligible participants were randomized in the ratio 1:1:1 to PST, referral to their physician, or a waitinglist control arm. PST is a manualized talking intervention delivered by a trained therapist who teaches people over six to eight sessions to implement a seven-step method for solving their problems. Referral to the physician involved sending a referral letter to the persons physician, encouraging him or her to consider treatment according to the stepped care protocol recommended by the U.K.s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms (6 months after baseline) as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS.

The purpose of this study was to compare two interventions for depression, problem solving treatment (PST) and referral to the patients physician, with a waiting-list control group in people with sight loss and depressive symptoms. METHODS. This was an assessor-masked, exploratory, multicenter, randomized clinical trial, with concurrent economic analysis. Of 1008 consecutive attendees at 14 low-vision rehabilitation centers in Britain, 43% (n 430) screened positive for depressive symptoms on the Geriatric Depression Scale and 85 of these attendees participated in the trial. Eligible participants were randomized in the ratio 1:1:1 to PST, referral to their physician, or a waitinglist control arm. PST is a manualized talking intervention delivered by a trained therapist who teaches people over six to eight sessions to implement a seven-step method for solving their problems. Referral to the physician involved sending a referral letter to the persons physician, encouraging him or her to consider treatment according to the stepped care protocol recommended by the U.K.s National Institute of Health and Care Excellence. The primary outcome was change in depressive symptoms (6 months after baseline) as determined by the Beck Depression Inventory. RESULTS. At 6 months, Beck Depression Inventory scores reduced by 1.05 (SD 8.85), 2.11 (SD 7.60), and 2.68 (SD 7.93) in the waiting-list control, referral, and PST arms, respectively. The cost per patient of the PST intervention was 1176 in Wales and 1296 in London. CONCLUSIONS. Depressive symptoms improved most in the PST group and least in the control group.

BMC Fam Pract. 2020;21(1):17.","10.1186/s12875-020-1090-9","Background


Despite an unparalleled global refugee crisis, there are almost no studies in primary care addressing real-world conditions and longer courses of treatment that are typical when resettled refugees present to their physician with critical psychosocial needs and complex symptoms. We studied the effects of a year of psychotherapy and case management in a primary care setting on common symptoms and functioning for Karen refugees (a newly arrived population in St Paul, Minnesota) with depression.





Methods


A pragmatic parallel-group randomized control trial was conducted at two primary care clinics with large resettled Karen refugee patient populations, with simple random allocation to 1 year of either: (1) intensive psychotherapy and case management (IPCM), or (2) care-as-usual (CAU). Eligibility criteria included Major Depression diagnosis determined by structured diagnostic clinical interview, Karen refugee, ages 18â65. IPCM (nâ=â112) received a year of psychotherapy and case management coordinated onsite between the case manager, psychotherapist, and primary care providers; CAU (nâ=â102) received care-as-usual from their primary care clinic, including behavioral health referrals and/or brief onsite interventions. Blinded assessors collected outcomes of mean changes in depression and anxiety symptoms (measured by Hopkins Symptom Checklist-25), PTSD symptoms (Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale), pain (internally developed 5-item Pain Scale), and social functioning (internally developed 37-item instrument standardized on refugees) at baseline, 3, 6 and 12âmonths. After propensity score matching, data were analyzed with the intention-to-treat principle using repeated measures ANOVA with partial eta-squared estimates of effect size.





Results


Of 214 participants, 193 completed a baseline and follow up assessment (90.2%). IPCM patients showed significant improvements in depression, PTSD, anxiety, and pain symptoms and in social functioning at all time points, with magnitude of improvement increasing over time. CAU patients did not show significant improvements. The largest mean differences observed between groups were in depression (difference, 5.5, 95% CI, 3.9 to 7.1, Pâ<â.001) and basic needs/safety (difference, 5.4, 95% CI, 3.8 to 7.0, Pâ<â.001).





Conclusions


Adult Karen refugees with depression benefited from intensive psychotherapy and case management coordinated and delivered under usual conditions in primary care. Intervention effects strengthened at each interval, suggesting robust recovery is possible.",NA,NA,NA,"Northwood, 2020","Northwood_2020_msd_hscl-d_post_52_clinician_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores of women who received IPT declined from 23.6 to 10.6 over 12 weeks, a significantly greater decrease than occurred in the WLC group (23.0 to 19.2). A significantly greater proportion of women who received IPT recovered from their depressive episode based on HRSD scores of 6 or lower (37. 5%) and BDI scores of 9 or lower (43.8%) compared with women in the WLC group (13.7% and 13.7%, respectively). Women receiving IPT also had significant improvement on the Postpartum Adjustment Questionnaire and the Social Adjustment Scale-Self-Report relative to women in the WLC group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that IPT is an efficacious treatment for postpartum depression. Interpersonal psychotherapy reduced depressive symptoms and improved social adjustment, and represents an alternative to pharmacotherapy, particularly for women who are breastfeeding.","Efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy for postpartum depression","http://archpsyc.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/PSYCH/11811/yoa9256.pdf","Arch Gen Psychiatry","O'Hara, 2000","O'Hara_2000_response(50%)_hdrs_post_NA_clinician_ipt_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

Behavioural Neurology, 2017","10.1155/2017/4058124","Background and Purpose. Poststroke depression (PSD) is a common complication after stroke. There is no adequate treatment for PSD. This study examined efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) in the treatment of PSD among stroke survivors. Methods. An experimental design, 30 participants with poststroke depression were randomly assigned into 3 groups of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT), psychoeducation (PE), and the control group (CG). CRT consisted of nine sessions with three-phased sessions focusing on activity stimulation, negative thoughts, and people contacts, PE consisted of nine sessions focusing on knowledge on stroke and poststroke depression, and the CG group was on the waiting list. The BDI scale was used for assessing PSD at posttest. Results. There was a significant difference in the efficacy of CRT, PE, and the CG on PSD, with CRT-CG mean difference of -9.4 +/- 3.11 and PE-CG 1.0 +/- 3.83. Furthermore, stress was not a confounding variable on the efficacy of CRT. The type of therapy significantly influenced PSD at posttest, with the CRT having greater mean reduction to CG (-11.1 +/- 3.1) than PE to the CG (3.0 +/- 3.8). Conclusions. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy significantly reduced poststroke depression. Hence, it should be integrated as an adjunct treatment of poststroke depression.

Behavioural Neurology, 2017","10.1155/2017/4058124","Background and Purpose. Poststroke depression (PSD) is a common complication after stroke. There is no adequate treatment for PSD. This study examined efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) in the treatment of PSD among stroke survivors. Methods. An experimental design, 30 participants with poststroke depression were randomly assigned into 3 groups of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT), psychoeducation (PE), and the control group (CG). CRT consisted of nine sessions with three-phased sessions focusing on activity stimulation, negative thoughts, and people contacts, PE consisted of nine sessions focusing on knowledge on stroke and poststroke depression, and the CG group was on the waiting list. The BDI scale was used for assessing PSD at posttest. Results. There was a significant difference in the efficacy of CRT, PE, and the CG on PSD, with CRT-CG mean difference of -9.4 +/- 3.11 and PE-CG 1.0 +/- 3.83. Furthermore, stress was not a confounding variable on the efficacy of CRT. The type of therapy significantly influenced PSD at posttest, with the CRT having greater mean reduction to CG (-11.1 +/- 3.1) than PE to the CG (3.0 +/- 3.8). Conclusions. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy significantly reduced poststroke depression. Hence, it should be integrated as an adjunct treatment of poststroke depression.

Exposing university students with blindness to a variety of rational emotive skills that would enable them to manage depression and depressive symptoms could be an important avenue to make them feel less depressed and become more energetic to successfully cope with their academic life. The objective of this study was to examine the efficacy of group-based rational emotive behavior therapy (REBT) intervention on depressive symptoms among selected university students with blindness in Nigeria. To assess the efficacy, a group randomized controlled trial design was employed. Participants (N = 65) recruited from universities in Southeast zone of Nigeria were randomly assigned to treatment (n = 33) and no-intervention control groups (n = 32) after meeting the study inclusionary criteria. REBT Depression Manual was used for the delivery of the intervention while depression was evaluated using Beck Depression Inventory-II. Students in the treatment group took part in the group-based REBT program for a period of 12 weeks and thereafter, a 2-week follow-up meeting, twice per week was done after 2 months of the intervention. All sessions lasted for about 60 min each. Data obtained were analyzed using a 2 3 within between-subjects ANOVA with repeated measures, independent samples t test and paired samples t-test. The study revealed that in comparison to the no-intervention control group, the REBT group had significant reduction in their depression scores both at post-treatment and follow-up evaluations, but no such changes were seen in the control group. Given that an REBT program led to the significant reduction in depression among students with blindness, the implication is that depressive thinking, beliefs, and feelings can be surmounted in this special need population through the application of REBT evidence-based techniques.

The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that delivering evidence-based behavior therapy for depression before a lifestyle weight loss intervention improves both weight loss and depression. DESIGN: In a randomized controlled trial, obese women with major depressive disorder (N=161, mean age=45.9 (s.d.: 10.8) years) were randomized to brief behavior therapy for depression treatment followed by a lifestyle intervention (BA) or a lifestyle intervention only (LI). Follow-up occurred at 6 and 12 months. Main outcome measures included weight loss and depression symptoms. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses revealed both conditions lost significant weight, but no differences between conditions in weight change at 6 months (BA=-3.0%, s.e.=-0.65%; LI=-3.7%, s.e.=0.63%; P=0.48) or 12 months (BA=-2.6%, s.e.=0.77%; LI=-3.1%, s.e.=0.74%; P=0.72). However, the BA condition evidenced significantly greater improvement in Beck Depression Inventory-II scores relative to the LI condition at both 6 months (BA mean change=-12.5, s.d.=0.85; LI mean change=-9.2, s.d.=0.80, P=0.005) and 12 months (BA mean change=-12.6, s.d.=0.97; LI mean change=-9.9, s.d.=0.93; P=0.045). Participants who experienced depression remission by 6 months (61.2%) lost greater weight (mean=-4.31%; s.e.=0.052) than those who did not (39.7%; mean=-2.47%, s.e.=0.53; P=.001).

Reducing negative thinking and depressive symptoms in college women. Journal of Nursing Scholarship. 2000;32(2):145-51.",NA,"PURPOSE: Although cognitive-behavioral interventions have been successful in treating depression, no studies were found that focused solely on reducing negative thinking via group intervention as a means of preventing depression in at-risk groups. The purpose of this randomized controlled trial was to test the effectiveness of a cognitive-behavioral group intervention in reducing depressive symptoms, decreasing negative thinking, and enhancing self-esteem in young women at risk for depression. DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial with 92 college women ages 18 to 24 who were at risk for depression was conducted. METHOD: Participants were randomly assigned to either the control or experimental group. The experimental group participated in a 6-week cognitive-behavioral group intervention. Data on self-esteem, depressive symptoms, and negative thinking were collected via self-report questionnaires from control and experimental groups at baseline, 1 month after the intervention, and at 6-month follow-up. Data were analyzed using mixed-model methodology and the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test. FINDINGS: Compared to those in the control group, women who received the intervention had a greater decrease in depressive symptoms and negative thinking and a greater increase in self-esteem, and these beneficial effects were maintained over 6-months. CONCLUSIONS: The findings document the effectiveness of this cognitive-behavioral group intervention and indicate empirical support for the beneficial effects of reducing negative thinking by the use of affirmations and thought-stopping techniques on women's mental health.","Reducing negative thinking and depressive symptoms in college women","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1547-5069.2000.00145.x/asset/j.1547-5069.2000.00145.x.pdf?v=1&t=iejvmudb&s=a0432a0b58d1b8734e2a44f5c90783cd4925cc57","J Nurs Scholarsh","Peden, 2000","Peden_2000_remission(cut-off)_bdi-1_post_NA_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

It compromises treatment adherence and accelerates disease progression. This study aimed to assess the feasibility of a group-based counselling intervention for depressed HIV-positive patients in primary health care (PHC) in South Africa using a task shifting approach. METHODS: Using a randomized control design, 76 HIV-positive patients with co-morbid depression were initially recruited. This reduced to 34 in the final cohort. Participants were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ9), Hopkins Symptom Checklist (HSCL-25) and Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS) at baseline and 3-month follow-up. The intervention was adapted from a local group-based Interpersonal Therapy (IPT) intervention. Process evaluation interviews were held with the HIV counsellors who delivered the intervention and a sub-sample of participants. RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA analysis showed significantly greater improvement on depression scores on the PHQ9 in the intervention group compared to the control group. A significant decline in the mean scores on the HSCL-25 was found for both groups although this was more pronounced for the intervention group. There was no significant improvement in the MSPSS scores. LIMITATIONS: The small sample size of the final cohort affected the power of the study to detect significant differences between the intervention and control groups on the MSPSS. Longer term impact of the intervention is unknown. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings suggest that group-based counselling for depression in HIV-positive patients can potentially be effectively delivered by appropriately trained and supported lay HIV counsellors. The need for a larger trial is indicated.","A group-based counselling intervention for depression comorbid with HIV/AIDS using a task shifting approach in South Africa: a randomized controlled pilot study","http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0165032714000445/1-s2.0-S0165032714000445-main.pdf?_tid=e3cdf052-d234-11e4-8d86-00000aab0f6b&acdnat=1427208713_053e7a86bcbebce5cc16b924c2171483 and http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0165032714000445/1-s2.0-S0165032714000445-main.pdf?_tid=0506425c-5ad8-11e5-b3dd-00000aab0f26&acdnat=1442232135_4b009d04d6018e0d9f9d1a136f05c6c9","J Affect Disord","Petersen, 2014","Petersen_2014_msd_phq-9_post_NA_self-report_ipt_cau_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

This study was aimed at exploring the effects of a psycho-educational intervention on depression- and diabetes-related outcomes in patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms. METHODS: A randomized controlled study design with a one-year follow-up was used. Fifty patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms (74% female, aged 57 +/- 9 yrs, diabetes duration of 10 +/- 8 yrs, BMI 31 +/- 6 kg/m2, HbA1C 7.7% +/- 1.4, 53% insulin treated) were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control group. The intervention group underwent four psycho-educational sessions aimed at enabling self-management of depressive symptoms. The control group was informed about the screening results and depression treatment options while continuing diabetes treatment as usual. Both groups were contacted by phone in 2-3-month intervals, and re-assessed for depression after 6 and 12 months. Changes in depressive symptoms and glycaemic control were considered primary outcomes. Mann-Whitney U test and Friedman ANOVA were used to compare between- and within-group indicators at 6- and 12-month follow-ups. RESULTS: Both the intervention and the control group reported a significant decrease in depressive symptoms as measured by the CES-D scale (Friedman ANOVA chi2 = 10.8 p = .004 and chi2 = 7.3 p = 0.03, respectively). The 6-month and 1-year indicators of glycaemic control as compared to baseline HbA1C values were also improved in both groups (chi2 = 11.6 p = 0.003 and chi2 = 17.1 p = 0.0002, respectively). Between-group differences in depressive symptoms and HbA1C values were not statistically significant either at 6- or at 12-month follow-up (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: Psycho-educational treatment appears to be beneficial in diabetic patients with mild to moderate depressive symptoms, but its effects are comparable with the non-specific support given to the subjects in the control group.

Trials. 2015 Jul 15;16:305.","10.1186/s13063-015-0833-8","BACKGROUND: Elevated depressive symptoms that do not reach criteria for a clinical diagnosis of depression are highly prevalent in persons with diabetes. This study was aimed at determining the efficacy of psychoeducation and physical exercise compared with enhanced treatment as usual on 1-year changes in depressive symptoms, diabetes distress and self-management, and quality of life and metabolic control in type 2 diabetes patients with subsyndromal depression. METHODS: Adult type 2 diabetes patients who screened positively for depression and expressed a need for professional help with mood-related issues were eligible. Exclusion criteria were clinical depression, current psychiatric treatment and advanced diabetes complications. Out of 365 eligible patients 209 consented to either 6 weekly sessions of psychoeducation (A) and physical exercise (B), or to enhanced treatment as usual (C). Computer-generated sequences for block randomisation stratified by gender were used. Depressive symptoms (primary outcome) and diabetes distress, diabetes self-care, metabolic control and health-related quality of life (secondary outcomes) were analysed at 6-month and 12-month follow-up using repeated-measures ANOVAs. RESULTS: Out of the 74 patients randomised into group A, 66 into B and 69 into group C, 203 completed the interventions, and 179 patients with all 3 assessments were analysed. Depressive symptoms in participants from the psychoeducational, physical exercise and the enhanced treatment as usual groups improved equally from baseline to 12-month follow-up (time versus time x group effect; F = 12.51, p < 0.001, eta(2) = 0.07 and F = 0.609, p = 0.656, eta(2) = 0.007 respectively), as did diabetes distress and quality of life (all p < 0.001), diabetes self-care (p < 0.001 to < 0.05), triglycerides, and total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The employed interventions had comparable positive effects on 12-month psychological and diabetes-related outcomes suggesting that even minimal intervention addressing patients' diabetes-related problems and concerns had favourable clinical implications and might be sufficient to treat subsyndromal depression. Further investigation is warranted to clarify possible mechanisms of improvement. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN05673017.

METHODS: We conducted a randomized controlled psychotherapy trial of 61 women from 2 urban medical practices who met criteria for major depressive disorder and chronic pelvic pain. Participants were assigned to receive either 8 sessions of IPT or a facilitated psychotherapy referral to a community mental health center, and assessed for depression, social interactions, and pain at 0-, 12-, 24-, and 36-weeks, with score on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression as the primary outcome.

This study describes the impact of this course in a pragmatic randomized controlled trial. Methods: Inclusion criteria were > 50 years, a score of 5 or higher on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), and no depressive disorder or psychotropic or psychological treatment. Participants were randomized and stratified by gender: the experimental group (N = 83) was offered the course and the comparison group (N = 88) a movie. There were three measurements: pre-treatment, post-treatment and 6 months after post-treatment. Depressive symptoms constituted the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes were anxiety symptoms, satisfaction with life, mastery and reminiscence styles. All analyses were conducted according to the intention-to-treat principle. Missing values were replaced by regression imputation. Results: The course reduced depressive symptoms, a decrease that was retained during follow-up. A significant between-group effect size was found (d = 0.58). There was also a reduction in symptoms of anxiety; however, the comparison group showed the same reduction, resulting in a small between-group effect size. Gender and level of depressive symptoms were found to be prognostic factors for the change in depressive symptoms; age was not. Post hoc analyses showed significant between-group effect sizes for females and those with a score above the cut-off of the CES-D. Conclusion: The course ""Looking for Meaning"" can be recommended for people aged over 50 years, females and older adults with a clinically relevant level of depressive symptoms (above cut-off) in particular.

Method: Five ECNs were trained in CBT and supervised weekly. Women were screened post-natally using the Edinburgh PND Scale (EPDS) and diagnostically assessed by a research registrar. Women with DSM-IV major or minor depression (n=37) were then randomized into either 'ideal standard care' (n=20) or CBT (n=17) for six weekly sessions. Two stages of follow-up were undertaken: research registrar interview immediately post-treatment and a postal follow-up at six months. Results: The training package was evaluated both by ECN completed questionnaires and analysis of taped therapy sessions. These evaluations indicated that ECNs could deliver modified CBT. There was a very high rate of recovery at initial follow-up with 70-80% recovered (EPDS < 10) in both groups. Six month follow-up showed a trend towards CBT being more effective in the longer term.

Additionally, the use of new media is becoming increasingly common in psychological interventions. The aim of this study was to investigate a life-review therapy in a face-to-face setting with additional computer use. This study explored whether a six-week life-review therapy with computer supplements from the e-mental health Butler system constitutes an effective approach to treat depression in older adults aged 65 and over. A total of 36 participants with elevated levels of depressive symptoms were randomized to a treatment group or a waiting-list control group and completed the post-assessment. Fourteen individuals in the intervention group completed the follow-up assessment. Analyses revealed significant changes from pre- to post-treatment or follow-up for depression, well-being, self-esteem, and obsessive reminiscence, but not for integrative reminiscence and life satisfaction. Depressive symptoms decreased significantly over time until the three-month follow-up in the intervention group compared to the control group (pre to post: d = 1.13; pre to follow-up: d = 1.27; and group x time effect pre to post: d = 0.72). Furthermore, the therapy led to an increase in well-being and a decrease in obsessive reminiscence among the participants in the intervention group from pre-treatment to follow-up (well-being: d = 0.70; obsessive reminiscence: d = 0.93). Analyses further revealed a significant but small group x time effect regarding self-esteem (d = 0.19). By and large, the results indicate that the life-review therapy in this combined setting could be recommended for depressive older adults.","Life-review therapy with computer supplements for depression in the elderly: a randomized controlled trial",NA,"Aging Ment Health","Preschl, 2012","Preschl_2012_msd_bdi-2_post_NA_self-report_lrt_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

Therapies that focus on supporting mothers have shown accelerated improvement in maternal well-being but few positive effects for infants (Cooper et al, 2003; Murray et al, 2003). Where interventions focus on addressing mother-infant interaction there appears greater chance of benefit to both mothers and children (Poobabn et al, 2007). A small waiting list controlled trial of a 14-week Mellow Babies group intervention was carried out with 17 mothers and infants under one year. Mellow Babies aims to promote both mother-infant interaction and maternal well-being. Changes in maternal depression (Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale) and the quality of mother-infant interaction (video observation) were assessed. Maternal mood in mothers attending Mellow Babies improved, with a significant difference in EPDS scores, relative to the control group, at follow-up. Post-intervention, there was a significant difference in levels of positive interactions between groups, favoring mothers attending Mellow Babies. The difference in negative interaction between Mellow Babies and waiting-list control group approached significance, with less negative interaction observed between mothers and infants who attended the group. Participant feedback on the content and process of Mellow Babies was highly positive. The study showed benefits from Mellow Babies for mothers and infants who had exposure to postnatal depression. Further studies with longer-term follow-up and infant outcome measures may substantiate these initial findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved).

Remarkably, many women suffering from this disorder do not receive appropriate treatment. The aim of this study was to conduct a parallel-group randomized controlled trial to determine the efficacy of Therapist-Assisted Internet-delivered Cognitive Behavior Therapy (TA-ICBT) for the treatment of postpartum depression. This study was registered with the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trials ( ISRCTN: 85456371) and received funding from Canadian Institutes of Health Research (#101526) and the Saskatchewan Health Research Foundation. Fifty women who gave birth to an infant in the past year, who scored above 10 on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and who resided in Saskatchewan, Canada were eligible to participate. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either TA-ICBT (n = 25) or waitlist control (n = 25). The efficacy of the treatment was investigated at baseline and at seven- to 10-week follow-up. TA-ICBT participants were also contacted four-weeks following treatment completion. Symptoms of postpartum depression decreased more for participants in the TA-ICBT group (average reduction of 6.24 points on the EPDS; n = 21 included in analyses) compared to those participants in the waitlist control group (average reduction of 2.42 points on the EPDS; n = 20 included in analyses), and these results were clinically significant and maintained at four-week follow-up. TA-ICBT participants demonstrated a reduction in postnatal anxiety, general stress, and parental distress, and an increase in psychological and environmental quality of life when compared to the waitlist control participants.

METHODS: Sixty-two breast cancer patients diagnosed with major depression were randomly assigned to GCBT group (N = 31) or a waiting list control group provided with an educational booklet (N = 31). The primary outcome measure was the 17-Item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (17-HAMD). The second outcome measures were Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Breast and Self-Esteem Scale (SES). Assessments were carried out at completion of the study and six-month afterwards. RESULTS: Patients in the GCBT group had a significant reduction in the 17-HAMD mean score by 9 points (p < 0.001), more than any reduction among patients in the control group from baseline to the end of therapy and a significant 7 points (p < 0.001) more reduction from baseline to six-month follow-up. GCBT also yielded significantly greater improvement than the control group with regard to quality of life (QoL; p < 0.01) and self-esteem (p < 0.05). No significant differences were found between groups on improving anxiety (p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: The results of this trial suggest that GCBT is effective for treating major depression, as well as for improving QoL and self-esteem in breast cancer patients.

We integrated a cognitive behaviour therapy-based intervention into the routine work of community-based primary health workers in rural Pakistan and assessed the effect of this intervention on maternal depression and infant outcomes. METHODS: We randomly assigned 40 Union Council clusters in rural Rawalpindi, Pakistan, in equal numbers to intervention or control. Married women (aged 16-45 years) in their third trimester of pregnancy with perinatal depression were eligible to participate. In the intervention group, primary health workers were trained to deliver the psychological intervention, whereas in the control group untrained health workers made an equal number of visits to the depressed mothers. The primary outcomes were infant weight and height at 6 months and 12 months, and secondary outcome was maternal depression. The interviewers were unaware of what group the participants were assigned to. Analysis was by intention to treat. The study is registered as ISRCTN65316374. FINDINGS: The number of clusters per group was 20, with 463 mothers in the intervention group and 440 in the control group. At 6 months, 97 (23%) of 418 and 211 (53%) of 400 mothers in the intervention and control groups, respectively, met the criteria for major depression (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.36, p<0.0001).

Methods: We trained 11 volunteers at two aging service settings in Do More, Feel Better and randomized 18 depressed clients to receive the intervention or referral to mental health services. Results: Pilot data indicated that we can successfully train and certify 64% of older volunteers and that depressed clients receiving the intervention reported high levels of session attendance and satisfaction. While there were no significant differences in 12-week reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores between groups, intervention clients showed an 8-point reduction in comparison with a 0-point reduction among referral clients. Conclusions: Do More, Feel Better has the potential of transferring evidence-based behavioral interventions to the hands of supervised lay volunteers and can address the insufficient workforce providing geriatric mental health services.","Lay-delivered behavioral activation for depressed senior center clients: Pilot RCT","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L2002472182 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/gps.5186 and https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/gps.5186","International Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry","Raue, 2019","Raue_2019_msd_hdrs_post_NA_clinician_bat_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Methods: A total of 131 individuals were randomized. Assessments took place at baseline (T1), six weeks (T2), and three months (T3). The primary endpoint was change in observer-based depression severity from T1 to T2. Potential negative effects were analyzed in terms of suicidal ideations, symptom deterioration, attitudes toward seeking further help, and other adverse events. Results: iCBT (n = 65) and OPE (n = 66) both reduced depressive symptoms from T1 to T2, with large changes observed for iCBT and medium for OPE (iCBT: Cohen's d = 1.09; OPE: d = 0.60). Differences between groups were significant at the primary endpoint (d = 0.36, p = 0.028). OPE continued to have a positive effect from post-treatment to follow-up, while the effect of iCBT remained stable, with differences between groups not being significant anymore at follow-up. Participants who had undergone prior psychotherapy benefited from both treatments; but for those without prior psychotherapy, iCBT was superior also at follow-up. In the iCBT group 26.2% of the participants reported at least one side-effect. Limitations: The history of psychotherapy was imbalanced between the groups. Some negative effects were assessed in the iCBT group only.

Internet interventions are particularly interesting in the context of increasing access to interventions, and delivering interventions population-wide. Methods: The study was a randomized controlled trial of an 7-module internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) program for adults with depressive symptoms (n = 96) compared to a waiting-list control group (n = 92). Participants received weekly support from a trained supporter. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II). The program was made available nationwide from an established and recognized charity for depression. Results: For the treatment group, post-treatment effect sizes reported were large for the primary outcome measure (d = 0.91). The between-group effects were moderate to large and statistically significant for the primary outcomes (d = 0.50) favoring the treatment group. Gains were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Conclusion: The study has demonstrated the efficacy of the internet-delivered Space from Depression treatment. Participants demonstrated reliable and statistically significant changes in symptoms from pre-to post-intervention. The study supports a model for delivering online depression interventions population-wide using trained supporters.

Methods: A randomized controlled trial compared 3 treatment conditions (all lasting 16 sessions) with a waiting list group (WL): CBASP, CBT with a focus on physical exercise (CBTE), and CBT with a focus on pleasurable, lowenergy and mindful activities (CBTM). We included 173 patients and involved 41 therapists. Assessments were at baseline, after session 8, and at the end of treatment. Results: Our primary outcome Beck Depression InventoryII indicated a general advantage of the CBT arms compared to CBASP [F(6, 154.5) = 4.2, p = 0.001], with significant contrasts in particular in favor of CBTE. Effect sizes against WL were d = 0.91 (CBTE), 0.87 (CBTM), and 0.47 (CBASP). A triple interaction with an additional factor ""chronic versus episodic depression"" [F(6, 142.7) = 2.2, p = 0.048] indicated that the treatments resulted in different outcomes, with best results again for CBTE in particular in episodic depression. Responder rates indicated significant improvements (56% in both CBT arms, 34% in the CBASP arm, 3.4% in WL; intentiontotreat samples). As compared to CBASP, response rates were significantly higher for CBTE (OR = 2.48; 95% CI = 1.026.00) and CBTM (OR = 2.46; 95% CI = 1.016.01). Conclusions: CBASP was more effective than WL, but less effective than the 2 CBT arms. This was mainly caused by an advantage of CBT interventions in episodic depression. Copyright 2018 S.

Due to the limited accessibility of CBT, long wait lists result in delayed treatment, which may affect treatment outcomes. The goal of this pilot study was to obtain preliminary data from a randomized controlled trial to determine whether delayed CBT reduces the effectiveness of the therapy compared to immediate CBT in patients with MDD receiving pharmacotherapy. Patients were randomized to receive immediate CBT (n=18) or to begin CBT after 6 months (n=20) and received 14 weekly sessions, followed by two additional booster sessions. During the active treatment months, patients in the immediate group demonstrated reductions in scores on the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II) that were similar to those in the delayed CBT group. However, when the analysis was performed using only data from patients in the delayed group who were still in a depressive episode, there was an overall greater decrease in BDI-II scores in the immediate group vs. the delayed group over the active treatment months, but not specifically at the 6-month endpoint. These findings suggest delays in depression treatment, similar to what occurs with real-world wait list times, may not have a significant impact on the effectiveness of CBT in patients who are already receiving treatment as usual. However, such delays may affect the effectiveness of CBT in those patients who remain depressed during the time delay. A larger trial is necessary to confirm these findings.

Method: 59 college students (M age = 21.8, SD = 2.3; 68% female, 70% White) were randomized to the 6-session Change Ahead group or educational brochure control condition, completing assessments at pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Recruitment and screening methods were effective and intervention attendance was high (86% attended all 6 sessions). Change Ahead participants showed medium-large reductions in depressive symptoms at posttest (M d = 0.64), though the effect attenuated by 3-month follow-up. Incidence of major depression onset at 3-month follow-up was 4% for Change Ahead participants versus 13% (difference ns).

Method: 59 college students (M age = 21.8, SD = 2.3; 68% female, 70% White) were randomized to the 6-session Change Ahead group or educational brochure control condition, completing assessments at pretest, posttest, and 3-month follow-up. Results: Recruitment and screening methods were effective and intervention attendance was high (86% attended all 6 sessions). Change Ahead participants showed medium-large reductions in depressive symptoms at posttest (M d = 0.64), though the effect attenuated by 3-month follow-up. Incidence of major depression onset at 3-month follow-up was 4% for Change Ahead participants versus 13% (difference ns).

New and more effective treatments are required. This is the first randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of Body Psychotherapy (BPT) in patients with chronic depression. METHODS: Patients with chronic depressive syndromes (more than 2 years symptomatic) and a total score of >/= 20 on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) were randomly allocated to either immediate BPT or a waiting group which received BPT 12 weeks later. BPT was manualized, delivered in small groups in 20 sessions over a 10 weeks period, and provided in addition to treatment as usual. In an intention to treat analysis, primary outcome were depressive symptoms at the end of treatment adjusted for baseline symptom levels. Secondary outcomes were self-esteem and subjective quality of life. RESULTS: Thirty-one patients were included and twenty-one received the intervention. At the end of treatment patients in the immediate BPT group had significantly lower depressive symptom scores than the waiting group (mean difference 8.7, 95% confidence interval 1.0-16.7). Secondary outcomes did not show statistically significant differences. When the scores of the waiting group before and after BPT (as offered after the waiting period) were also considered in the analysis, the differences with the initial waiting group remained significant. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that BPT may be an effective treatment option for patients with chronic depression. Difficulty recruiting and subsequent attrition was one of the limitations, but the findings merit further trials with larger samples and process studies to identify the precise therapeutic mechanisms.","An exploratory randomized controlled trial of body psychotherapy for patients with chronic depression","http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0165032713004357/1-s2.0-S0165032713004357-main.pdf?_tid=105c33c6-5ada-11e5-b570-00000aab0f27&acdnat=1442233012_31473ba382f72e5ff475c1e16e23bebb","J Affect Disord","Rohricht, 2013","Rohricht_2013_msd_hdrs_post_0_clinician_otherpsy_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

Depress Anxiety, 34(3), 236-245.","10.1002/da.22590","METHODS: In this parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, adult MDD participants (18-45 years) were randomized to a 10-week period of iCBT (n = 37) or monitored attention control (MAC; n = 40). Participants in the iCBT group completed six online therapy lessons, which included access to content summaries and homework assignments. During the 10-week trial, iCBT and MAC participants logged into the web-based system six times to complete self-report symptom scales, and a nonclinician technician contacted participants weekly to provide encouragement and support. The primary outcome was the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD), and the secondary outcomes were the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and Kessler-10.RESULTS: Intent-to-treat analyses revealed significantly greater reductions in depressive symptoms in iCBT compared with MAC participants, using both the self-report measures and the clinician-rated HRSD (d = -0.80). Importantly, iCBT participants also showed significantly higher rates of clinical response and remission. Exploratory analyses did not support illness severity as a moderator of treatment outcome.CONCLUSIONS: The Sadness Program led to significant reductions in depression and distress symptoms. With its potential to be delivered in a scalable, cost-efficient manner, iCBT is a promising strategy to enhance access to effective care.BACKGROUND: Prior research has shown that the Sadness Program, a technician-assisted Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) intervention developed in Australia, is effective for treating major depressive disorder (MDD).

DESIGN: A two arm, randomized, controlled, cross-over trial comparing CBT-AD to enhanced treatment as usual only (ETAU). ETAU, which both groups received, included a single-session intervention for adherence and a letter to the patient's provider documenting her or his continued depression. The intervention group also received 10 to 12 sessions of CBT-AD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy as assessed by Medication Event Monitoring Systems (MEMs) and depression as assessed by blinded structured evaluation. RESULTS: At the acute outcome assessment (3-months), those who received CBT-AD evidenced significantly greater improvements in medication adherence and depression relative to the comparison group. Those who were originally assigned to the comparison group who chose to cross over to CBT-AD showed similar improvements in both depression and adherence outcomes. Treatment gains for those in the intervention group were generally maintained at 6- and 12-month follow-up assessments. By the end of the follow-up period, those originally assigned CBT-AD demonstrated improvements in plasma HIV RNA concentrations, though these differences did not emerge before the cross-over, and hence there were not between-groups differences.

Methods In this three-arm randomised controlled trial in HIV-positive adults with depression, we compared CBT-AD with information and supportive psychotherapy plus adherence counselling using the Life-Steps approach (ISP-AD), and with enhanced treatment as usual (ETAU) including Life-Steps adherence counselling only. Participants were recruited from three sites in New England, USA (two hospital settings and one community health centre).

The primary outcome was ART adherence at the end of treatment (4 month assessment) assessed via electronic pill caps (Medication Event Monitoring System [MEMS]) with correction for pocketed doses, analysed by intention to treat. Findings Patients were recruited from Feb 26, 2009, to June 21, 2012. Patients who were assigned to CBT-AD (94 randomly assigned, 83 completed assessment) had greater improvements in adherence (estimated difference 100 percentage point per visit, 95% CI 034 to 166, p=0003) and depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies depression [CESD] score estimated difference 041, 066 to 016, p=0001; Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale [MADRS] score 469, 809 to 128, p=0007; clinical global impression [CGI] score 066, 111 to 021, p=0005) than did patients who had ETAU (49 assigned, 46 completed assessment) after treatment (4 months). No significant differences in adherence were noted between CBT-AD and ISP-AD (97 assigned, 87 completed assessment). No study-related adverse events were reported. Interpretation Integrating evidenced-based treatment for depression with evidenced-based adherence counselling is helpful for individuals living with HIV/AIDS and depression. Future efforts should examine how to best disseminate effective psychosocial depression treatments such as CBT-AD to people living with HIV/AIDS and examine the cost-effectiveness of such approaches.

METHODS: All adult patients (N = 1515) with MDD symptoms referred to secondary care in 2004-2006 were screened. Eligible, consenting patients were assigned randomly to 10-week IPT (N = 46), PeGT (N = 42), or TAU (N = 46) treatment arms. Antidepressant pharmacotherapy among study participants was evaluated. The Hamilton Depression Rating scale (HAM-D) was the primary outcome measure. Assessment occurred at 1, 5, 3, 6, and 12 months. Actual amount of therapists' labor was also evaluated. All statistical analyses were performed with R software. RESULTS: All three treatment cells showed marked improvement at 12-month follow-up.

Studies examining the efficacy of individual format CT interventions that may ensure more long-term maintenance of benefits are necessary. This study assessed the efficacy of CT for depression administered individually in women with metastatic breast cancer and its effect on immune function. METHOD: Forty-five women were randomly assigned to either individual CT or to a waiting-list control (WLC) condition. CT was composed of eight weekly sessions of CT and three booster sessions administered at 3-week intervals following the end of treatment. RESULTS: Patients treated with CT had significantly lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at posttreatment compared to untreated patients. Pooled data from both groups indicated significant reductions of depressive symptoms from pre- to posttreatment, as well as reduction of associated symptoms including anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia symptoms. These effects were well sustained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations. CT for depression did not appear to have a significant impact on immune functioning.

A prior controlled trial of CT in a group format showed improvements in depression, mood disturbance, and self-esteem; however, these effects were not maintained over time. Studies examining the efficacy of individual format CT interventions that may ensure more long-term maintenance of benefits are necessary. This study assessed the efficacy of CT for depression administered individually in women with metastatic breast cancer and its effect on immune function. METHOD: Forty-five women were randomly assigned to either individual CT or to a waiting-list control (WLC) condition. CT was composed of eight weekly sessions of CT and three booster sessions administered at 3-week intervals following the end of treatment. RESULTS: Patients treated with CT had significantly lower scores on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at posttreatment compared to untreated patients. Pooled data from both groups indicated significant reductions of depressive symptoms from pre- to posttreatment, as well as reduction of associated symptoms including anxiety, fatigue, and insomnia symptoms. These effects were well sustained at the 3- and 6-month follow-up evaluations. CT for depression did not appear to have a significant impact on immune functioning. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Findings of this study support the efficacy of CT for depression in this population and suggest that the administration of individual and booster sessions after treatment termination may be instrumental in sustaining the treatment effects over time.","Randomized clinical trial on cognitive therapy for depression in women with metastatic breast cancer: psychological and immunological effects",NA,"Palliat Support Care","Savard, 2006","Savard_2006_msd_hads-d_post_0_self-report_cbt_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

RESULTS: Severity of depressive symptoms was reduced more rapidly and more effectively among patients randomized to pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy than among patients assigned to a physician's usual care.

OBJECTIVE: To determine the clinical effectiveness of CBT delivered in primary care for older people with depression. DESIGN: A single-blind, randomized, controlled trial with 4- and 10-month follow-up visits. PATIENTS: A total of 204 people aged 65 years or older (mean [SD] age, 74.1 [7.0] years; 79.4% female; 20.6% male) with a Geriatric Mental State diagnosis of depression were recruited from primary care. INTERVENTIONS: Treatment as usual (TAU), TAU plus a talking control (TC), or TAU plus CBT. The TC and CBT were offered over 4 months. OUTCOME MEASURES: Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) scores collected at baseline, end of therapy (4 months), and 10 months after the baseline visit. Subsidiary measures were the Beck Anxiety Inventory, Social Functioning Questionnaire, and Euroqol. Intent to treat using Generalized Estimating Equation and Compliance Average Causal Effect analyses were used. RESULTS: Eighty percent of participants were followed up.

Intent-to-treat analysis found improvements of -3.07 (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.73 to -0.42) and -3.65 (95% CI, -6.18 to -1.12) in BDI-II scores in favor of CBT vs TAU and TC, respectively.

METHOD: Mothers (N = 70) of children enrolled in Head Start, who reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms, were randomized to either the 8-session, Internet-facilitated intervention (Mom-Net) or delayed intervention/facilitated treatment-as-usual (DI/TAU). Outcomes were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996); the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999), Behavioral Observations of Parent-Child Interactions using the Living in Family Environments coding system (LIFE; Hops, Davis, & Longoria, 1995); the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding Systems (DPICS; Eyberg, Nelson, Duke, & Boggs, 2005); the Parent Behavior Inventory (PBI; Lovejoy, Weis, O'Hare, & Rubin, 1999); and the Parenting Sense of Competence scale (PSOC; Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman, 1978). RESULTS: Mom-Net demonstrated high levels of feasibility as indicated by low attrition and high program usage and satisfaction ratings. Participants in the Mom-Net condition demonstrated significantly greater reduction in depression, the primary outcome, at the level of both symptoms and estimates of criteria-based diagnoses over the course of the intervention.

METHOD: Mothers (N = 70) of children enrolled in Head Start, who reported elevated levels of depressive symptoms, were randomized to either the 8-session, Internet-facilitated intervention (Mom-Net) or delayed intervention/facilitated treatment-as-usual (DI/TAU). Outcomes were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II; Beck, Steer, & Brown, 1996); the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9; Spitzer et al., 1999), Behavioral Observations of Parent-Child Interactions using the Living in Family Environments coding system (LIFE; Hops, Davis, & Longoria, 1995); the Dyadic Parent-Child Interaction Coding Systems (DPICS; Eyberg, Nelson, Duke, & Boggs, 2005); the Parent Behavior Inventory (PBI; Lovejoy, Weis, O'Hare, & Rubin, 1999); and the Parenting Sense of Competence scale (PSOC; Gibaud-Wallston & Wandersman, 1978). RESULTS: Mom-Net demonstrated high levels of feasibility as indicated by low attrition and high program usage and satisfaction ratings. Participants in the Mom-Net condition demonstrated significantly greater reduction in depression, the primary outcome, at the level of both symptoms and estimates of criteria-based diagnoses over the course of the intervention. They also demonstrated significantly greater improvement on a questionnaire measure of parent satisfaction and efficacy as well as on both questionnaire and observational indices of harsh parenting behavior.

We adapted THP for delivery by volunteer peers (laywomen from the community) to address the human resource needs in bridging the treatment gap, and we aimed to assess its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. Methods: In this cluster randomised controlled trial, we randomly assigned 40 village clusters (1:1) to provide either THP peer-delivered (THPP) and enhanced usual care (EUC; intervention group) or EUC only (control group) to the participants within clusters. These villages were randomly selected from eligible villages by an independent researcher. The participants were pregnant women aged 18 years or older who had scored at least 10 on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), who we recruited from households within communities in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. The research teams who were responsible for recruiting trial participants were masked to treatment allocations. Participants attended follow-up visits at 3 and 6 months after childbirth. The primary outcomes were the severity of depressive symptoms (assessed by PHQ-9 score) and the prevalence of remission (defined as a PHQ-9 score of less than 5) in participants with available data 6 months after childbirth, which was assessed by researchers who were masked to treatment allocations. We analysed outcomes by intention to treat, adjusting for covariates that were defined a priori or that showed imbalance at baseline. The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02111915. Findings: Between April 15 and July 30, 2014, we randomly selected 40 of 46 eligible village clusters for assessment, as per sample size calculations. Between Oct 15, 2014, and Feb 25, 2016, we identified and screened 971 women from 20 village clusters that had been randomly assigned to the THPP and EUC group and 939 women from 20 village clusters that had been randomly assigned to the EUC only group. In the intervention group, 79 women were ineligible for inclusion, 11 women refused screening, 597 women screened negative on the PHQ-9, and one woman did not consent to participate. In the control group, 75 women were ineligible for inclusion, 14 women refused screening, 562 women screened negative on the PHQ-9, and one woman did not consent to participate. We enrolled 283 (29%) women in the intervention group and 287 (31%) women in the control group. At 6 months after childbirth, 227 (80%) women in the THPP and EUC group and 226 (79%) women in the EUC only group were assessed for the primary outcome. The severity of depression (assessed by PHQ-9 scores; standardised mean difference 013, 95% CI 031 to 006; p=007) and prevalence of remission (49% in the intervention group vs 45% in the control group; prevalence ratio 112, 95% CI 095 to 129; p=014) did not significantly differ between the groups 6 months after childbirth. There was no evidence of significant differences in serious adverse events between the groups. Interpretation: THPP had no effect on symptom severity or remission from perinatal depression at 6 months after childbirth, but we found that it was beneficial on some other metrics of severity and disability and that it was cost-effective.

Psychotherapy treatments in diabetes mellitus can lead to improvements in both depressive symptoms and glycaemic control. The objective of this study was to investigate whether depressive symptoms can be reduced by psychotherapy treatment delivered as a joint interdisciplinary service to in-patients with diabetic foot syndrome and comorbid depression. METHODS: Thirty in-patients with diabetic foot syndrome and comorbid depression were randomized to either an intervention group (n = 15) with supportive psychotherapy treatment or a control group (n = 15) that received only standard medical treatment. Patients completed a set of questionnaires at the beginning and end of treatment. These recorded sociodemographic variables, anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale) and diabetes-related problems (Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale). RESULTS: Although the diabetic foot syndrome improved significantly in 75% of patients, the extent of depressive symptoms and anxiety reported by the control group did not decrease by the end of treatment. In contrast, in the intervention group, anxiety, depression and diabetes-related problems were all reduced. The extent of anxiety and depression was not, as had been anticipated, associated with the severity of the physical symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that psychotherapeutic intervention during in-patient treatment can have a positive influence on anxiety, depressive symptoms and diabetes-related problems in patients with diabetic foot syndrome.","Psychotherapy intervention to reduce depressive symptoms in patients with diabetic foot syndrome","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/j.1464-5491.2007.02370.x/asset/j.1464-5491.2007.02370.x.pdf?v=1&t=iejwnmg2&s=ab2fb28468cd41c15e044c0f64c1e03ddd9db93c","Diabet Med","Simson, 2008","Simson_2008_msd_hads-d_post_0_self-report_sup_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

We used a randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a self-help programme in reducing depression in people with depression in Chiang Mai Province in Thailand. Fifty-six individuals diagnosed with moderate depression participated. They were assigned randomly to an intervention (n= 27) or control (n= 29) group. The intervention group were given a self-help manual along with standard care and treatment, while the control group continued to receive standard care and treatment. Both groups were also given a short weekly telephone call. The findings showed statistically significant differences between the groups, and within the intervention group, in their depression levels. Between baseline and post-test, a sharp decrease in depression was evident in the intervention group, whereas the level of depression increased in the control group. Between post-test and follow-up, a decrease was apparent in depression in both groups. However, the intervention group showed a much lower level of depression than the control group.

Although we previously demonstrated the efficacy of interpersonal psychotherapy for antepartum depression in a sample of Hispanic women, this study provides a larger, more diverse sample of African American, Hispanic, and white pregnant women from 3 New York City sites in order to provide greater generalizability. METHOD: A 12-week bilingual, parallel-design, controlled clinical treatment trial compared interpersonal psychotherapy for antepartum depression to a parenting education program control group. An outpatient sample of 142 women who met DSM-IV criteria for major depressive disorder was randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy or the parenting education program from September 2005 to May 2011. The 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17) was the primary outcome measure of mood. Other outcome scales included the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and the Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI). The Maternal Fetal Attachment Scale (MFAS) assessed mother's interaction with the fetus. RESULTS: Although this study replicated previous findings that interpersonal psychotherapy is a beneficial treatment for antepartum depression, the parenting education program control condition showed equal benefit as measured by the HDRS-17, EPDS, CGI, and MFAS. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the recommendation for the use of interpersonal psychotherapy for mild-to-moderate major depressive disorder in pregnancy. The parenting education program may be an alternative treatment that requires further study.

There is a need to develop effective strategies to treat depression and prevent recurrence. Treatments that combine pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches are preferred for treating severe forms of depression. PURPOSE: The study assesses the effect of an integrated body-mind-spirit group intervention in patients with depression. METHODS: This pilot study was a pretest-posttest design study. Thirty adult patients diagnosed with depression attending the psychiatric outpatient department at a district hospital were randomly assigned to either the intervention group or comparison group. Each group had 15 patients. The intervention group received both the intervention and routine hospital treatment and underwent four group integrated body-mind-spirit group intervention therapy sessions. These sessions were held once per week on either Saturday or Sunday, with each session lasting more than 3 hours. Comparison group participants received routine hospital treatment only. Outcome measures, including level of depression, well-being, and work and social adjustment, were measured using the Beck Depression Inventory-II, body-mind-spirit well-being scale, and work and social adjustment scale. Both groups were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months. RESULTS: Results showed that both groups had significant reductions in the level of depression, improvements in well-being, and work and social adjustment at 3-month follow-up compared with baseline. In addition, the intervention group showed significant mean differences in levels of depression, well-being, and work and social adjustment compared with the comparison group. CONCLUSION: The integrated body-mind-spirit group intervention model appears to reduce depressive symptoms and improve well-being in patients with depression.","Effectiveness of integrated body-mind-spirit group intervention on the well-being of Indian patients with depression: a pilot study","http://graphics.tx.ovid.com/ovftpdfs/FPDDNCGCDHGGHG00/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/00134372/00134372-201309000-00006.pdf and http://graphics.tx.ovid.com/ovftpdfs/FPDDNCIBDGBBNB00/fs046/ovft/live/gv023/00134372/00134372-201309000-00006.pdf","J Nurs Res","Sreevani, 2013","Sreevani_2013_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait-list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait-list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4-week follow-up period; wait-list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks.

Smartphone apps stand as a possible means to overcome such barriers. However, there is limited evidence to understand the use and efficacy of these apps. The purpose of the current study was to pilot an evaluation of the usage and efficacy of apps for depression based upon behavioral or cognitive intervention skills, compared to a wait-list control. Thirty adults with depression were randomized to the use of either a behavioral app (Boost Me) or a cognitive app (Thought Challenger) or to a wait-list control. Boost Me and Thought Challenger participants received 6 weeks of the respective intervention along with weekly coaching sessions, with a 4-week follow-up period; wait-list control participants received no interventions for 10 weeks. A repeated-measures analysis of variance was conducted to examine depression over time and across treatment groups; t tests compared app usage across groups. Depression scores changed significantly over time (p < .001), with group differences occurring between Thought Challenger and wait-list control participants (p = .03).

METHOD: Twenty-eight participants with chronic depression were randomly allocated to treatment as usual (TAU) or PBCT group plus TAU. Assessments of depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI-II) and mindfulness (Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire) were conducted before and after therapy. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis found significant group by time interactions for both depression and mindfulness. Secondary analyses showed depression and mindfulness scores significantly improved for PBCT participants but not for TAU participants, with 64% of PBCT participants showing reliable improvement in depression, compared with 0% of TAU participants. CONCLUSIONS: PBCT is a promising treatment for chronic depression. Findings suggest a full RCT would be warranted.","Group person-based cognitive therapy for chronic depression: a pilot randomized controlled trial","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.2044-8260.2012.02036.x/abstract","Br J Clin Psychol","Strauss, 2012","Strauss_2012_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_cbt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

When maternal depression remains untreated, mothers suffer, and psychiatric illness in their offspring is less likely to improve. This randomized, controlled trial compared the interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed mothers (IPT-MOMS), a nine-session intervention based on standard interpersonal psychotherapy, to treatment as usual for depressed mothers with psychiatrically ill offspring. METHOD: Forty-seven mothers meeting DSM-IV criteria for major depression were recruited from a pediatric mental health clinic where their school-age children were receiving psychiatric treatment and randomly assigned to IPT-MOMS (N=26) or treatment as usual (N=21). Mother-child pairs were assessed at three time points: baseline, 3-month follow-up, and 9-month follow-up. Child treatment was not determined by the study. RESULTS: Compared to subjects assigned to treatment as usual, subjects assigned to IPT-MOMS showed significantly lower levels of depression symptoms, as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and higher levels of functioning, as measured by the Global Assessment of Functioning, at 3-month and 9-month follow-ups. Compared to the offspring of mothers receiving treatment as usual, the offspring of mothers assigned to IPT-MOMS showed significantly lower levels of depression as measured by the Children's Depressive Inventory at the 9-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Assignment to IPT-MOMS was associated with reduced levels of maternal symptoms and improved functioning at the 3- and 9-month follow-ups compared to treatment as usual. Maternal improvement preceded improvement in offspring, suggesting that maternal changes may mediate child outcomes.","Brief interpersonal psychotherapy for depressed mothers whose children are receiving psychiatric treatment","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2757752/pdf/nihms141465.pdf","Am J Psychiatry","Swartz, 2008","Swartz_2008_msd_bdi-1_post_0_self-report_ipt_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Therefore, it was considered that a simple intervention conducted in short sessions, focusing on increasing access to positively reinforcing activities, would be efficacious in increasing the availability of rewards. We conduct a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of such a behavioral activation program that was conducted weekly for 5weeks in 60-min sessions. Late adolescent university students aged 1819years with subthreshold depression were randomly allocated to a treatment (n=62) or a control group (n=56). The primary outcome of the study was the Beck Depression Inventory-II score. Results indicated that late adolescent students in the treatment group showed significant improvements in their depressive symptoms (effect size 0.90, 95% CI 1.28 to 0.51) compared to the control group. Students in the treatment group also showed significant improvements in self-reported rating of quality of life and in behavioral characteristics. It is concluded that this intervention had a large and significant effect despite being short and simple and that this low-intensity cognitive behavioral therapy program could be conducted in many different types of institutions. It is suggested that the long-term effects of the treatment program should be targeted for investigation in future studies.","Behavioral activation for late adolescents with subthreshold depression: a randomized controlled trial","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L609238550 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00787-016-0842-5 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=1435165X&id=doi:10.1007%2Fs00787-016-0842-5&atitle=Behavioral+activation+for+late+adolescents+with+subthreshold+depression%3A+a+randomized+controlled+trial&stitle=Eur.+Child+Adolesc.+Psychiatry&title=European+Child+and+Adolescent+Psychiatry&volume=25&issue=11&spage=1171&epage=1182&aulast=Takagaki&aufirst=Koki&auinit=K.&aufull=Takagaki+K.&coden=EAPSE&isbn=&pages=1171-1182&date=2016&auinit1=K&auinitm= and http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/206/art%253A10.1007%252Fs00787-016-0842-5.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs00787-016-0842-5&token2=exp=1484320730~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F206%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs00787-016-0842-5.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs00787-016-0842-5*~hmac=3eb9175db0772d2bec7c30e37d6066e23e9711d7caa6468f3e1b09caabbbb01d","European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry","Takagaki, 2016","Takagaki_2016_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_bat_cau_NA_NA","B - Non-Western"

METHODS: Among 1,100 women seeking treatment in a CMHC, 230 (21%) had major depression and histories of childhood sexual abuse. Seventy women with major depression and sexual abuse before age 18 were randomly assigned to interpersonal psychotherapy (N=37) or usual care psychotherapy (N=33).

Traditional risk factors (e.g., lipids, blood pressure) and C-reactive protein were assessed pre- and post-treatment six months later.

Health Technol Assess, 23(47), 1-176. doi:10.3310/hta23470","10.3310/hta23470","BACKGROUND: There is currently insufficient evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological therapies for post-stroke depression. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of undertaking a definitive trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of behavioural activation (BA) compared with usual stroke care for treating post-stroke depression. DESIGN: Parallel-group, feasibility, multicentre, randomised controlled trial with nested qualitative research and a health economic evaluation. SETTING: Acute and community stroke services in three sites in England. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults 3 months to 5 years post stroke who are depressed, as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or the Visual Analogue Mood Scales 'Sad' item. Exclusions: patients who are blind and/or deaf, have dementia, are unable to communicate in English, do not have mental capacity to consent, are receiving treatment for depression at the time of stroke onset or are currently receiving psychological intervention. RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: Participants were randomised (1:1 ratio) to BA or usual stroke care. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated list with random permuted blocks of varying sizes, stratified by site. Participants and therapists were aware of the allocation, but outcome assessors were blind. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention arm received up to 15 sessions of BA over 4 months. BA aims to improve mood by increasing people's level of enjoyable or valued activities. The control arm received usual care only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary feasibility outcomes concerned feasibility of recruitment to the main trial, acceptability of research procedures and measures, appropriateness of baseline and outcome measures, retention of participants and potential value of conducting the definitive trial. Secondary feasibility outcomes concerned the delivery of the intervention. The primary clinical outcome 6 months post randomisation was the PHQ-9. Secondary clinical outcomes were Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire - Hospital version, Nottingham Leisure Questionnaire, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living, Carer Strain Index, EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version and health-care resource use questionnaire. RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were recruited in 27 centre-months of recruitment, at a recruitment rate of 1.8 participants per centre per month. The 25 participants randomised to receive BA attended a mean of 8.5 therapy sessions [standard deviation (SD) 4.4 therapy sessions]; 23 participants were allocated to usual care. Outcome assessments were completed by 39 (81%) participants (BA, n=18; usual care, n=21). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 6-month follow-up were 10.1 points (SD 6.9 points) and 14.4 points (SD 5.1 points) in the BA and control groups, respectively, a difference of -3.8 (95% confidence interval -6.9 to -0.6) after adjusting for baseline PHQ-9 score and centre, representing a reduction in depression in the BA arm. Therapy was delivered as intended. BA was acceptable to participants, carers and therapists. Value-of-information analysis indicates that the benefits of conducting a definitive trial would be likely to outweigh the costs. It is estimated that a sample size of between 580 and 623 participants would be needed for a definitive trial. LIMITATIONS: Target recruitment was not achieved, although we identified methods to improve recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: The Behavioural Activation Therapy for Depression after Stroke trial was feasible with regard to the majority of outcomes. The outstanding issue is whether or not a sufficient number of participants could be recruited within a reasonable time frame for a definitive trial. Future work is required to identify whether or not there are sufficient sites that are able to deliver the services required for a definitive trial.

Health Technol Assess, 23(47), 1-176. doi:10.3310/hta23470","10.3310/hta23470","BACKGROUND: There is currently insufficient evidence for the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of psychological therapies for post-stroke depression. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the feasibility of undertaking a definitive trial to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of behavioural activation (BA) compared with usual stroke care for treating post-stroke depression. DESIGN: Parallel-group, feasibility, multicentre, randomised controlled trial with nested qualitative research and a health economic evaluation. SETTING: Acute and community stroke services in three sites in England. PARTICIPANTS: Community-dwelling adults 3 months to 5 years post stroke who are depressed, as determined by the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) or the Visual Analogue Mood Scales 'Sad' item. Exclusions: patients who are blind and/or deaf, have dementia, are unable to communicate in English, do not have mental capacity to consent, are receiving treatment for depression at the time of stroke onset or are currently receiving psychological intervention. RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: Participants were randomised (1:1 ratio) to BA or usual stroke care. Randomisation was conducted using a computer-generated list with random permuted blocks of varying sizes, stratified by site. Participants and therapists were aware of the allocation, but outcome assessors were blind. INTERVENTIONS: The intervention arm received up to 15 sessions of BA over 4 months. BA aims to improve mood by increasing people's level of enjoyable or valued activities. The control arm received usual care only. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary feasibility outcomes concerned feasibility of recruitment to the main trial, acceptability of research procedures and measures, appropriateness of baseline and outcome measures, retention of participants and potential value of conducting the definitive trial. Secondary feasibility outcomes concerned the delivery of the intervention. The primary clinical outcome 6 months post randomisation was the PHQ-9. Secondary clinical outcomes were Stroke Aphasic Depression Questionnaire - Hospital version, Nottingham Leisure Questionnaire, Nottingham Extended Activities of Daily Living, Carer Strain Index, EuroQol-5 Dimensions, five-level version and health-care resource use questionnaire. RESULTS: Forty-eight participants were recruited in 27 centre-months of recruitment, at a recruitment rate of 1.8 participants per centre per month. The 25 participants randomised to receive BA attended a mean of 8.5 therapy sessions [standard deviation (SD) 4.4 therapy sessions]; 23 participants were allocated to usual care. Outcome assessments were completed by 39 (81%) participants (BA, n=18; usual care, n=21). Mean PHQ-9 scores at 6-month follow-up were 10.1 points (SD 6.9 points) and 14.4 points (SD 5.1 points) in the BA and control groups, respectively, a difference of -3.8 (95% confidence interval -6.9 to -0.6) after adjusting for baseline PHQ-9 score and centre, representing a reduction in depression in the BA arm. Therapy was delivered as intended. BA was acceptable to participants, carers and therapists. Value-of-information analysis indicates that the benefits of conducting a definitive trial would be likely to outweigh the costs. It is estimated that a sample size of between 580 and 623 participants would be needed for a definitive trial. LIMITATIONS: Target recruitment was not achieved, although we identified methods to improve recruitment. CONCLUSIONS: The Behavioural Activation Therapy for Depression after Stroke trial was feasible with regard to the majority of outcomes. The outstanding issue is whether or not a sufficient number of participants could be recruited within a reasonable time frame for a definitive trial. Future work is required to identify whether or not there are sufficient sites that are able to deliver the services required for a definitive trial.

METHOD: Randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing three groups: Clinician-assisted vs. technician-assisted vs. delayed treatment. Community-based volunteers applied to the VirtualClinic (www.virtualclinic.org.au) research program, and 141 participants with major depressive disorder were randomized. Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT program for depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health QUESTIONnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9).

Participants in the clinician- and technician-assisted groups received access to an iCBT program for depression comprising 6 online lessons, weekly homework assignments, and weekly supportive contact over a treatment period of 8 weeks. Participants in the clinician-assisted group also received access to a moderated online discussion forum. The main outcome measures were the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and the Patient Health QUESTIONnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9). Completion rates were high, and at post-treatment, both treatment groups reduced scores on the BDI-II (p<0.001) and PHQ-9 (p<0.001) compared to the delayed treatment group but did not differ from each other. Within group effect sizes on the BDI-II were 1.27 and 1.20 for the clinician- and technician-assisted groups respectively, and on the PHQ-9, were 1.54 and 1.60 respectively. At 4-month follow-up participants in the technician group had made further improvements and had significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 than those in the clinician group. A total of approximately 60 minutes of clinician or technician time was required per participant during the 8-week treatment program. CONCLUSIONS: Both clinician- and technician-assisted treatment resulted in large effect sizes and clinically significant improvements comparable to those associated with face-to-face treatment, while a delayed treatment control group did not improve. These results provide support for large scale trials to determine the clinical effectiveness and acceptability of technician-assisted iCBT programs for depression. This form of treatment has potential to increase the capacity of existing mental health services.

The aim of the present randomized controlled trial (RCT) was to examine the efficacy, long-term outcomes, and cost-effectiveness of a therapist-guided internet-delivered cognitive behavior therapy (iCBT) intervention for Australian adults over 60 years of age with symptoms of depression. Participants were randomly allocated to either a treatment group (n=29) or a delayed-treatment waitlist control group (n=25). Twenty-seven treatment group participants started the iCBT treatment and 70% completed the treatment within the 8-week course, with 85% of participants providing data at posttreatment. Treatment comprised an online 5-lesson iCBT course with brief weekly contact with a clinical psychologist, delivered over 8 weeks. The primary outcome measure was the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 Item (PHQ-9), a measure of symptoms and severity of depression. Significantly lower scores on the PHQ-9 (Cohen's d=2.08; 95% CI: 1.38 - 2.72) and on a measure of anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Item) (Cohen's d=1.22; 95% CI: 0.61 - 1.79) were observed in the treatment group compared to the control group at posttreatment. The treatment group maintained these lower scores at the 3-month and 12-month follow-up time points and the iCBT treatment was rated as acceptable by participants.

Yet, there are few interventions that target depressive symptoms and HIV risk for people who use drugs (PWUD). This study was a randomized controlled trial of an integrated cognitive behavioral therapy and HIV prevention intervention to reduce depressive symptoms, injection risk behaviors and increase condom use in a sample of urban people who used heroin or cocaine in the prior 6 months. A total of 315 individuals aged 18-55, who self-reported at least one HIV drug and sex risk behavior and scored >/=16 and <40 on the Centers for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale were randomized using a two-block design, stratified by sex to ensure equivalent numbers, to a 10 session intervention arm (n = 162) or a single session control arm (n = 153). The outcomes of interest were decreases in CES-D score and injection risk behaviors and increases in condom use. The sample was majority African American (85%) and unemployed (94%). Nearly half (47%) reported injection in the prior 6 months and only 19% were taking medication for depression. Follow-up assessments were conducted at 6 and 12 months. Retention at 12 months was 94%. Intervention arm was associated with statistically significantly lower CES-D score at 12 month compared to control. No differences were observed between arms in injection risk. At 6 month, intervention was associated with greater odds of condom use with non-main partner. These findings suggest the potential role of the integrated intervention in reducing depressive symptoms, but weak impact on HIV risk. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov under the title ""Neighborhoods, Networks, Depression, and HIV Risk"" number NCT01380613.","RCT of an integrated CBT-HIV intervention on depressive symptoms and HIV risk","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5730221/pdf/pone.0187180.pdf","PLoS One","Tobin, 2017","Tobin_2017_msd_ces-d_post_0_self-report_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA","A - Western"

METHOD: Fifty-seven community dwelling cardiac patients scoring >13 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) received a single-session brief intervention. They were then block randomised to either six sessions of group CBT (n = 25) or no further intervention (BI; n = 32). All were re-assessed at 2, 6 and 12 months. Differences between treatment groups in the primary (BDI-II) and secondary [rates of depression; anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A)] outcomes were examined using generalised linear mixed models with a random intercept term for the individual. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen for the total group from baseline to 12 months on BDI-II and HADS-A scores. However, no differences were found between the CBT and BI conditions on change in BDI-II score, rates of major depressive episode or HADS-A score.

METHOD: Fifty-seven community dwelling cardiac patients scoring >13 on the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) received a single-session brief intervention. They were then block randomised to either six sessions of group CBT (n = 25) or no further intervention (BI; n = 32). All were re-assessed at 2, 6 and 12 months. Differences between treatment groups in the primary (BDI-II) and secondary [rates of depression; anxiety symptoms, as measured by the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety (HADS-A)] outcomes were examined using generalised linear mixed models with a random intercept term for the individual. RESULTS: Significant improvements were seen for the total group from baseline to 12 months on BDI-II and HADS-A scores. However, no differences were found between the CBT and BI conditions on change in BDI-II score, rates of major depressive episode or HADS-A score. Post hoc analysis on the total group found 12-month symptom non-remission was associated with higher baseline BDI-II score (p = 0.03), more visits to health professionals 12 months prior to baseline (p = 0.05) and a greater likelihood of either drinking alcohol over recommended levels or smoking at baseline (p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Group CBT of up to six sessions did not result in greater reductions in depression or anxiety symptoms compared with a single-session brief intervention. Further work should focus on the efficacy and role of brief interventions, and addressing smoking and alcohol misuse in cardiac patients with depression.","Randomised controlled trial of group cognitive behaviour therapy versus brief intervention for depression in cardiac patients","http://anp.sagepub.com/content/47/3/235.full.pdf","Aust N Z J Psychiatry","Turner, 2013","Turner_2013_remission(diag)_scid(iv)_post_0_self-report_cbt_otherctr_NA_NA","A - Western"

Web-based depression treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients: A randomized, controlled trial.

Depression can be effectively treated with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). The Internet is a new and attractive method for delivering CBT intervention on a large scale at relatively low costs. This study evaluated the effectiveness of Web-based CBT for depression treatment in adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, with minimal guidance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A randomized controlled trial was conducted in the Netherlands in 255 adult diabetic patients with elevated depressive symptoms. Primary outcomes were depressive symptoms. Secondary outcomes were diabetes-specific emotional distress and glycemic control. Assessments were at baseline, after treatment, and at the 1-month follow-up. RESULTS: The Web-based CBT was effective in reducing depressive symptoms by intention-to-treat analyses (P = 0.04, d = 0.29; clinical improvement 41% vs. 24% P < 0.001) and by per-protocol analyses (P < 0.001, d = 0.70; clinical improvement, 56% vs. 24% P < 0.001). The intervention reduced diabetes-specific emotional distress (P = 0.03) but had no beneficial effect on glycemic control (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Web-based CBT depression treatment is effective in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. In addition, the intervention reduces diabetes-specific emotional distress in depressed patients.","Web-based depression treatment for type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients: a randomized, controlled trial","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3024341/pdf/320.pdf","Diabetes Care","van Bastelaar, 2011","vanBastelaar_2011_otherdich(sign.change)_ces-d_post_0_self-report_cbt_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

The secondary aim was to conduct a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the behavioral activation component alone compared to the complete cognitive-behavioral intervention. Method: Sixty-one caregivers (mean age 58.4 years) were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral intervention via conference call (CBC, n = 20), a behavioral activation intervention via conference call (BAC, n = 22) or a control group receiving usual care (CG, n = 19). Both interventions consisted of five 90-minute group sessions implemented weekly. Results: Only 6.6% of caregivers discontinued the study. In the CBC and BAC groups, attendance and satisfaction with the intervention were similarly high among both groups. Homework adherence was also high in both groups. At post-treatment, there was a lower incidence of depression in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (0.0% for BAC and CBC vs. 10.5% for CG). The relative risk was 0.0, and number needed to treat was 10 in both groups. Depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (d = 2.18 and d = 2.06).

The secondary aim was to conduct a preliminary assessment of the efficacy of the behavioral activation component alone compared to the complete cognitive-behavioral intervention. Method: Sixty-one caregivers (mean age 58.4 years) were randomly assigned to a cognitive-behavioral intervention via conference call (CBC, n = 20), a behavioral activation intervention via conference call (BAC, n = 22) or a control group receiving usual care (CG, n = 19). Both interventions consisted of five 90-minute group sessions implemented weekly. Results: Only 6.6% of caregivers discontinued the study. In the CBC and BAC groups, attendance and satisfaction with the intervention were similarly high among both groups. Homework adherence was also high in both groups. At post-treatment, there was a lower incidence of depression in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (0.0% for BAC and CBC vs. 10.5% for CG). The relative risk was 0.0, and number needed to treat was 10 in both groups. Depressive symptoms were significantly reduced in the CBC and BAC groups compared to the CG (d = 2.18 and d = 2.06). Conclusion: The results support the feasibility of the intervention. Moreover, the BAC intervention was non-inferior to the CBC intervention for reducing depressive symptoms.

Behaviour Research and Therapy. 2010;48(5):368-76.","10.1016/j.brat.2010.01.005","Internet-delivered psychological treatment of major depression has been investigated in several trials, but the role of personalized treatment is less investigated. Studies suggest that guidance is important and that automated computerized programmes without therapist support are less effective. Individualized e-mail therapy for depression has not been studied in a controlled trial. Eighty-eight individuals with major depression were randomized to two different forms of Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), or to a waiting-list control group. One form of Internet treatment consisted of guided self-help, with weekly modules and homework assignments. Standard CBT components were presented and brief support was provided during the treatment. The other group received e-mail therapy, which was tailored and did not use the self-help texts i.e., all e-mails were written for the unique patient. Both treatments lasted for 8 weeks. In the guided self-help 93% completed (27/29) and in the e-mail therapy 96% (29/30) completed the posttreatment assessment. Results showed significant symptom reductions in both treatment groups with moderate to large effect sizes.

Eighty-eight individuals with major depression were randomized to two different forms of Internet-delivered cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), or to a waiting-list control group. One form of Internet treatment consisted of guided self-help, with weekly modules and homework assignments. Standard CBT components were presented and brief support was provided during the treatment. The other group received e-mail therapy, which was tailored and did not use the self-help texts i.e., all e-mails were written for the unique patient. Both treatments lasted for 8 weeks. In the guided self-help 93% completed (27/29) and in the e-mail therapy 96% (29/30) completed the posttreatment assessment. Results showed significant symptom reductions in both treatment groups with moderate to large effect sizes. At posttreatment 34.5% of the guided self-help group and 30% of the e-mail therapy group reached the criteria of high-end-state functioning (Beck Depression Inventory score below 9). At six-month follow-up the corresponding figures were 47.4% and 43.3%. Overall, the difference between guided self-help and e-mail therapy was small, but in favour of the latter.

METHODS: Eighty-seven women who sought treatment from a public health service in Curico, Chile, and who had severe depression and a history of childhood traumatic experiences were randomly assigned to receive either the intervention (N=44) or standard treatment (N=43). The participants were assessed at baseline and at three months (completion of the intervention) and six months with use of the Hamilton Depression Scale (Ham-D); Lambert's Outcome Questionnaire (OQ-45.2), which rates psychiatric symptoms, interpersonal relationships, and social role functioning; and the Post-traumatic Stress Treatment Outcome scale (PTO 8), which assesses symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder. An intent-to-treat design was used with multiple analyses of variance. RESULTS: At three months significant differences were found in favor of the intervention group in Ham-D scores (p<.001) and OQ-45.2 scores (p<.05).

The Internet may offer interesting alternatives for reaching and helping people with depression. Depression can be treated effectively with Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), but a short intervention based on problem solving therapy (PST) could constitute a worthwhile alternative to CBT. OBJECTIVE: In this study we evaluated the effectiveness of Internet-based CBT and Internet-based PST in comparison to a waiting list control group (WL), and we determined the differences between the two treatments. METHODS: We conducted a 3-arm randomized controlled trial to compare CBT, PST, and WL. The main inclusion criterion was presence of depressive symptoms (>or= 16 on the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale). CBT and PST consisted of eight and five weekly lessons respectively. Participants were supported by email. Self-report measures of depression, anxiety, and quality of life were completed at pretest and after 5, 8, and 12 weeks. RESULTS: A total of 263 participants were randomized to the three conditions (CBT: n=88; PST: n=88; WL: n=87). Of the 263 participants, 184 (70%) completed questionnaires after 5 weeks, 173 (66%) after 8 weeks, and 151 (57%) after 12 weeks.

These effects were further improved at 12 weeks (CBT: 0.69, 95% CI: 0.41 - 0.98; PST: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.36 - 0.95). For anxiety, effect sizes were also at a medium level.

This randomized trial provides the first controlled data on an innovative cognitive bias modification (CBM) training guided self-help intervention for depression. METHOD: One hundred and twenty-one consecutively recruited participants meeting criteria for current major depression were randomly allocated to treatment as usual (TAU) or to TAU plus concreteness training (CNT) guided self-help or to TAU plus relaxation training (RT) guided self-help. CNT involved repeated practice at mental exercises designed to switch patients from an unhelpful abstract thinking habit to a helpful concrete thinking habit, thereby targeting depressogenic cognitive processes (rumination, overgeneralization). RESULTS: The addition of CNT to TAU significantly improved depressive symptoms at post-treatment [mean difference on the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) 4.28, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.29-7.26], 3- and 6-month follow-ups, and for rumination and overgeneralization post-treatment. There was no difference in the reduction of symptoms between CNT and RT (mean difference on the HAMD 1.98, 95% CI -1.14 to 5.11), although CNT significantly reduced rumination and overgeneralization relative to RT post-treatment, suggesting a specific benefit on these cognitive processes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that CNT guided self-help may be a useful addition to TAU in treating major depression in primary care, although the effect was not significantly different from an existing active treatment (RT) matched for structural and common factors.

There was no difference in the reduction of symptoms between CNT and RT (mean difference on the HAMD 1.98, 95% CI -1.14 to 5.11), although CNT significantly reduced rumination and overgeneralization relative to RT post-treatment, suggesting a specific benefit on these cognitive processes. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary evidence that CNT guided self-help may be a useful addition to TAU in treating major depression in primary care, although the effect was not significantly different from an existing active treatment (RT) matched for structural and common factors. Because of its relative brevity and distinct format, it may have value as an additional innovative approach to increase the accessibility of treatment choices for depression.","Guided self-help concreteness training as an intervention for major depression in primary care: a Phase II randomized controlled trial","http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2FPSM%2FPSM42_07%2FS0033291711002480a.pdf&code=a6d85304797ecfae5e74d9e8bd98cb77","Psychol Med","Watkins, 2012","Watkins_2012_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_otherpsy_cau_otherpsy(cnt+cau)_cau","A - Western"

The current article evaluates an online life review therapy in middle-aged and older persons, comparing a counselor-led to a peer-supported mode of delivery. Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out with 3 conditions and 4 measurement points: (a) online life review therapy with online counseling, (b) online life review therapy with online peer support, and (c) a waitlist control condition. A mixed methods study provided insight in the reach, adherence, effectiveness, user experiences, and acceptability. Results: Fifty-eight people were included in the study. The intervention reached a vulnerable group of mainly middle-aged, college-educated women. The pilot RCT on effectiveness showed that participants in all conditions improved significantly in depressive symptoms, engaged living, mastery, and vitality, but not in ego integrity and despair, social support, loneliness, and well-being. The adherence, user experience, and acceptability were better in the counselor condition than in the peer condition. No differences were found between middle-aged and older adults. Conclusion: Despite the nonsignificant effects, possibly due to the small sample size, online life review therapy might be a good method for alleviating depressive symptoms in people in their second half of life.

The current article evaluates an online life review therapy in middle-aged and older persons, comparing a counselor-led to a peer-supported mode of delivery. Methods: A pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) was carried out with 3 conditions and 4 measurement points: (a) online life review therapy with online counseling, (b) online life review therapy with online peer support, and (c) a waitlist control condition. A mixed methods study provided insight in the reach, adherence, effectiveness, user experiences, and acceptability. Results: Fifty-eight people were included in the study. The intervention reached a vulnerable group of mainly middle-aged, college-educated women. The pilot RCT on effectiveness showed that participants in all conditions improved significantly in depressive symptoms, engaged living, mastery, and vitality, but not in ego integrity and despair, social support, loneliness, and well-being. The adherence, user experience, and acceptability were better in the counselor condition than in the peer condition. No differences were found between middle-aged and older adults. Conclusion: Despite the nonsignificant effects, possibly due to the small sample size, online life review therapy might be a good method for alleviating depressive symptoms in people in their second half of life.

OBJECTIVE: To compare the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy in primary care settings among older persons with minor depression or dysthymia. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled trial (November 1995-August 1998). SETTING: Four geographically and clinically diverse primary care practices. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 415 primary care patients (mean age, 71 years) with minor depression (n = 204) or dysthymia (n = 211) and a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) score of at least 10 were randomized; 311 (74.9%) completed all study visits. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomly assigned to receive paroxetine (n = 137) or placebo (n = 140), starting at 10 mg/d and titrated to a maximum of 40 mg/d, or problem-solving treatment-primary care (PST-PC; n = 138). For the paroxetine and placebo groups, the 6 visits over 11 weeks included general support and symptom and adverse effects monitoring; for the PST-PC group, visits were for psychotherapy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Depressive symptoms, by the 20-item Hopkins Symptom Checklist Depression Scale (HSCL-D-20) and the HDRS; and functional status, by the Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form 36 (SF-36) physical and mental components. RESULTS: Paroxetine patients showed greater (difference in mean [SE] 11-week change in HSCL-D-20 scores, 0.21 [0. 07]; P =.004) symptom resolution than placebo patients. Patients treated with PST-PC did not show more improvement than placebo (difference in mean [SE] change in HSCL-D-20 scores, 0.11 [0.13]; P =.13), but their symptoms improved more rapidly than those of placebo patients during the latter treatment weeks (P =.01). For dysthymia, paroxetine improved mental health functioning vs placebo among patients whose baseline functioning was high (difference in mean [SE] change in SF-36 mental component scores, 5.8 [2.02]; P =. 01) or intermediate (difference in mean [SE] change in SF-36 mental component scores, 4.4 [1.74]; P =.03). Mental health functioning in dysthymia patients was not significantly improved by PST-PC compared with placebo (P>/=.12 for low-, intermediate-, and high-functioning groups). For minor depression, both paroxetine and PST-PC improved mental health functioning in patients in the lowest tertile of baseline functioning (difference vs placebo in mean [SE] change in SF-36 mental component scores, 4.7 [2.03] for those taking paroxetine; 4.7 [1.96] for the PST-PC treatment; P =.02 vs placebo). CONCLUSIONS: Paroxetine showed moderate benefit for depressive symptoms and mental health function in elderly patients with dysthymia and more severely impaired elderly patients with minor depression. The benefits of PST-PC were smaller, had slower onset, and were more subject to site differences than those of paroxetine.","Treatment of dysthymia and minor depression in primary care: A randomized controlled trial in older adults","http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/o/cochrane/clcentral/articles/681/CN-00299681/frame.html and http://jama.jamanetwork.com/data/Journals/JAMA/4753/JOC00569.pdf","Jama","Williams, 2000","Williams_2000_remission(cut-off_dysthymia)_hdrs_post_0_clinician_pst_otherctr_NA_NA","A - Western"

GSH-CBT will have improved mood and knowledge of the causes and treatment of depression compared to the control receiving TAU 2. Guided self-help will be acceptable to patients and staff. Methods and Findings: Participants: Adults attending seven general practices in Glasgow, UK with a BDI-II score of (greater-than or equal to)14. 141 randomised to GSH-CBT and 140 to TAU. Interventions: RCT comparing 'Overcoming Depression: A Five Areas Approach' book plus 3-4 short face to face support appointments totalling up to 2 hours of guided support, compared with general practitioner TAU. Primary outcome: The BDI (II) score at 4 months. Numbers analysed: 281 at baseline, 203 at 4 months (primary outcome), 117 at 12 months. Outcome: Mean BDI-II scores were lower in the GSH-CBT group at 4 months by 5.3 points (2.6 to 7.9, p<0.001). At 4 and 12 months there were also significantly higher proportions of participants achieving a 50% reduction in BDI-II in the GSH-CBT arm. The mean support was 2 sessions with 42.7 minutes for session 1, 41.4 minutes for session 2 and 40.2 minutes of support for session 3. Adverse effects/Harms: Significantly less deterioration in mood in GSH-CBT (2.0% compared to 9.8% in the TAU group for BDI-II category change). Limitations: Weaknesses: Our follow-up rate of 72.2% at 4 months is better than predicted but is poorer at 12 months (41.6%). In the GSH-CBT arm, around 50% of people attended 2 or fewer sessions. 22% failed to take up treatment. Conclusions: GSH-CBT is substantially more effective than TAU.

British Journal of Psychiatry 2018; 212(2): 88-95.","10.1192/bjp.2017.18","Background To date no studies have explored the effectiveness of written cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) resources for low mood and stress delivered via a course of self-help classes in a community setting. Aims To assess the effectiveness of an 8-week community-based CBT self-help group classes on symptoms of depression, anxiety and social function at 6 months (trial registration: ISRCTN86292664). Method In total, 142 participants were randomly allocated to immediate (n = 71) or delayed access to a low-intensity CBT intervention (n = 71). Measures of depression, anxiety and social function were collected at baseline and 6 months. Results There was a significant improvement for the primary outcome of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score (mean betweengroup difference: -3.64, 95% CI -6.06 to -1.23; P = 0.004). The percentage of participants reducing their PHQ-9 score between baseline and 6 months by 50% ormore was 17.9% for the delayed access group and 43.8% for the immediate access group. Secondary outcomes also improved including anxiety and social function. The intervention was cost neutral. The probabilities of a net benefit at willingness to pay thresholds of 20 000, 25 000 or 30 000 were 0.928, 0.944 and 0.955, respectively.

Aims To assess the effectiveness of an 8-week community-based CBT self-help group classes on symptoms of depression, anxiety and social function at 6 months (trial registration: ISRCTN86292664). Method In total, 142 participants were randomly allocated to immediate (n = 71) or delayed access to a low-intensity CBT intervention (n = 71). Measures of depression, anxiety and social function were collected at baseline and 6 months. Results There was a significant improvement for the primary outcome of Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) score (mean betweengroup difference: -3.64, 95% CI -6.06 to -1.23; P = 0.004). The percentage of participants reducing their PHQ-9 score between baseline and 6 months by 50% ormore was 17.9% for the delayed access group and 43.8% for the immediate access group. Secondary outcomes also improved including anxiety and social function. The intervention was cost neutral. The probabilities of a net benefit at willingness to pay thresholds of 20 000, 25 000 or 30 000 were 0.928, 0.944 and 0.955, respectively. Conclusions Low-intensity class-based CBT delivered within a community setting is effective for reducing depression, anxiety and impaired social function at little additional cost.

METHOD: Three hundred and forty-seven subjects with depressive symptoms (i.e. Beck Depression Inventory-Chinese version >9) were randomly assigned to CBT and waitlist control groups. RESULTS: After 10 weeks of treatment, participants in the group CBT programme had significantly fewer symptoms of depression, fewer dysfunctional and perfectionist attitudes, and better quality of life when compared to the participants in the control group. Effect size statistics showed small to medium differences in symptoms of depression, dysfunctional and perfectionist attitudes and quality of life between the two groups (Cohen's d, 0.22-0.74). Statistical analysis of the clinical significance indicated that approximately 27% of the participants in the experimental group could be considered as clinically remitted or recovered, respectively (RCI >1.28). Last, multiple regression provided some evidence of a linkage between cognition and depression among the participants in the experimental group.

Annals of family medicine 2018; 16(2): 111â9.","10.1370/afm.2206","PURPOSE: We undertook a randomized controlled trial to assess the efficacy of groupbased behavioral activation with mindfulness (BAM) for treating subthreshold depression in primary care in Hong Kong. METHODS: We recruited adult patients aged 18 years or older with subthreshold depression from public primary care clinics and randomly assigned them to a BAM intervention group or a usual care group. The BAM group was provided with eight 2hour weekly BAM sessions by trained allied health care workers. Patients in the usual care group received usual medical care with no additional psychological interventions. The primary outcome was depressive symptoms measured by the Beck Depression InventoryII at 12 months. Secondary outcomes included incidence of major depressive disorder at 12 months. We assessed quality of life, activity and circumstances change, functional impairment, and anxiety at baseline, end of intervention, 5 months, and 12 months. RESULTS: We randomly allocated 115 patients to the BAM intervention and 116 patients to usual care. At 12 months, compared with usual care peers, BAM patients had a slightly more favorable change in levels of depressive symptoms on the Beck Depression InventoryII (betweengroup mean difference in score = 3.85; 95% CI, 6.36 to 1.34; Cohen d = 0.46, 95% CI, 0.76 to 0.16). Incidence of major depressive disorder was lower with BAM (10.8% vs 26.8%, P = .01), whereas groups did not differ significantly on other secondary outcomes at 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: Group BAM appears to be efficacious for decreasing depressive symptoms and reducing the incidence of major depression among patients with subthreshold depression in primary care, although generalizability of our findings may be limited.","Treating Subthreshold Depression in Primary Care: a Randomized Controlled Trial of Behavioral Activation With Mindfulness","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01627218/full and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5847348/pdf/0160111.pdf","Annals of family medicine","Wong, 2018","Wong_2018_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_3rd_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

However, little research has examined the effectiveness of psychological programs to treat comorbid anxiety and depression in older adults. Sixty-two community dwelling adults aged over 60 years with comorbid anxiety and depression were randomly allocated to group cognitive behavioural therapy or a waitlist condition and were assessed immediately following and three months after treatment. After controlling for cognitive ability at pre-treatment, cognitive behaviour therapy resulted in significantly greater reductions, than waitlist, on symptoms of anxiety and depression based on a semi-structured diagnostic interview rated by clinicians unaware of treatment condition.

METHOD: This is a randomized study registered in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR-IOR-17011289). Eighty rural left-behind elderly people who had a Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) score between 11 and 25 were randomly assigned to the intervention (n=40) and control group (n=40). The intervention group received both MBAT and regular treatment for 8 weeks while the control group received regular treatment. Both groups were assessed with the GDS, Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Oxford Happiness Questionnaire (OHQ) at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and at 3 months post-intervention. RESULTS: There were a total of 73 participants that completed the intervention. The scores of GDS and BAI decreased significantly, but the scores of OHQ increased significantly in the intervention group after 8 sessions of MBAT (P<.01). The reduction in depression symptoms after the intervention was maintained at the 3-month follow-up. Significant differences in GDS, BAI, and OHQ scores were observed between the intervention group and the control group (P<.01). CONCLUSION: MBAT produced a significantly greater reduction in depressive symptoms than regular care in rural left-behind elderly. Clinical or methodological significance of this article: A modified behavioral activation (BA) psychotherapy can significantly reduce the recurrence and seriousness of depression symptoms in the left-behind elderly with mild to moderate depression. This study also suggests that further study of the MBAT as an intervention will provide a direction for the management of mental health in rural left-behind elders.","A randomized study on the effect of modified behavioral activation treatment for depressive symptoms in rural left-behind elderly","https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28838290 and https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10503307.2017.1364444","Psychotherapy research : journal of the Society for Psychotherapy Research","Xie, 2019","Xie_2019_msd_gds_post_0_self-report_bat_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

The current study attempted to design and test a comprehensive selfcontrol training (CSCT) program with an overall emphasis on behaviral activation in depressed Chinese college students. METHODS: Participants included 74 students who had diagnosed with major depression, they were randomly assigned to one of the two groups: intervention group (n=37), and control group (n=37). The intervention participants received an eightweek CSCT and fourmonth followup consolidation program, as compared to the control group who received only prepostandfollowup measurements. All participants measured Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and Selfcontrol Scale (SCS) at three time points: baseline, posttraining, and fourmonth followup. RESULTS: The dropout rates were 6 (8.1%) in the intervention group and 3 (4.1%) in the control group at the end of sixmonth intervention. The general linear model repeated measures analysis of variance revealed that comparing with the control group, the intervention group participants had more increase in their trait selfcontrol score, at the meantime, their depressive symptoms had significantly improved. Univariate and logistic regression analyses revealed that participants with milder baseline depressive symptoms were more likely to benefit from CSCT interventions; depression improvement was also associated with the number of sessions attended. LIMITATIONS: The main limitation was related to the small sample size which consisted of college students who were relatively young and well educated. CONCLUSIONS: The current study demonstrates that CSCT program could temporarily enhance selfcontrol capacity as well as improve depressive symptoms; participants who are mildly to moderately depressed, and who could adhere to the training protocol are more likely to benefit from the intervention.","Comprehensive self-control training benefits depressed college students: a six-month randomized controlled intervention trial","https://www.cochranelibrary.com/central/doi/10.1002/central/CN-01421524/full","Journal of affective disorders","Yang, 2018","Yang_2018_msd_bdi-2_post_0_self-report_otherpsy_cau_NA_NA","A - Western"

Methods: Seventy-five Chinese patients with depression in outpatient clinics were randomized into a 5-week intervention. The intervention group received the Chinese translated version of MoodGYM in addition to usual treatment, and the control group continued with usual treatment. Participants completed the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D) pre- and post-intervention. Results: We conducted multivariate linear regression analyses to compare the change in CES-D scores for completers after the intervention. Seventy-eight percent (n = 29) of participants in the intervention group and 84% (n = 32) of patients in the control group completed the post-treatment assessments, and no serious adverse events were reported. Results indicated that while both groups significantly improved at post test, the intervention group improved significantly more than the control group (t(59) = 2.37, p = 0.02). Conclusion: Computerized CBT can be a cost-effective adjunct to medication treatment, particularly in areas with limited access to mental health services. The use of online computerized CBT has been found to be effective in many studies in Western countries, but has not been studied among Chinese outpatients. This study suggests that online computerized CBT is acceptable, and that MoodGYM is a feasible and efficacious augmentative treatment, specifically when used within an outpatient clinic population. With this small sample size we were able to demonstrate that the addition of MoodGYM to usual care improved treatment outcomes for outpatients with depression in China.","Outcomes of an online computerized cognitive behavioral treatment program for treating chinese patients with depression: A pilot study","http://www.embase.com/search/results?subaction=viewrecord&from=export&id=L619354556 and http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajp.2017.11.007 and http://vu.on.worldcat.org/atoztitles/link?sid=EMBASE&issn=18762026&id=doi:10.1016%2Fj.ajp.2017.11.007&atitle=Outcomes+of+an+online+computerized+cognitive+behavioral+treatment+program+for+treating+chinese+patients+with+depression%3A+A+pilot+study&stitle=Asian+J.+Psychiatry&title=Asian+Journal+of+Psychiatry&volume=&issue=&spage=&epage=&aulast=Yeung&aufirst=Albert&auinit=A.&aufull=Yeung+A.&coden=&isbn=&pages=-&date=2017&auinit1=A&auinitm=","Asian Journal of Psychiatry","Yeung, 2017","Yeung_2017_change_ces-d_post_0_self-report_cbt_wl_NA_NA","A - Western"

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an antenatal depression screening and intervention among Chinese high-risk pregnant women with medically defined complications. METHODS: Using a randomized controlled trial design, we enrolled 352 pregnant women with obstetrical complications and an Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) 9 or postpartum depression screen scale (PDSS) 60. These participants were randomly assigned into the intervention group (n=176) and control group (n=176). The intervention group underwent a six-session group intervention with one session focused on the husbands; the control group received the usual care. Participants were assessed at baseline, late pregnancy (28weeks), 3 days and 42days after delivery with PDSS and EPDS. RESULTS: Analysis of variance of repeated measures showed significant differences at each time point between groups. Analysis of the Kruskal-Wallis test showed that there was no statistically significant differences in the PDSS and EPDS scores at any time point among the high-risk pregnant women who attended different frequencies of the maternal intervention sessions (P>0.05).

The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of CBT, antidepressants alone (MED), combined CBT and antidepressants (COMB) and standard treatment (ST; i.e., receiving psycho-educational intervention and/or medication treatment determined by treating psychiatrists) on depressive symptoms and social functioning in Chinese patients with moderatesevere MDD. Method: A total of 180 patients diagnosed with MDD according to ICD-10 were randomly allocated to one of the four treatment regimens for a period of 6 months. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (C-QIDS-SR). Remission threshold was defined as a C-QIDS-SR total score of <5. Social functioning was evaluated with the Work and Social Adjustment Scale (WSAS). All outcome measures were evaluated at entry, and at 3- and 6-months follow-up. Results: At the 6-months assessment, the remission rates in the whole sample (n = 96), the MED, the CBT, the COMB and the ST groups were 54.2%, 48%, 75%, 53.5% and 50%, respectively. Following the treatment periods, there was no significant difference in any of the study outcomes between the four groups. However, the CBT showed the greatest effect in the HAMD total score with the effect size = 0.94, whereas the ST has only a moderate effect size in the WSAS total score (effect size = 0.47). Conclusions: The findings support the feasibility and effectiveness of CBT as a psychosocial intervention for Chinese patients with moderatesevere MDD. We also found that single treatment using MED or CBT performed equally well as the combined CBT-antidepressant treatment in controlling the remission.
