This study sought to examine the efficacy of brief intervention strategies. Design: Randomized trial. Setting: College campuses. Participants: A total of 117 college student problem and pathological gamblers. Interventions: Students were assigned randomly to: an assessment-only control, 10 minutes of brief advice, one session of motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or one session of MET, plus three sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The three interventions were designed to reduce gambling. Measurements: Gambling was assessed at baseline, week 6 and month 9 using the Addiction Severity Index-gambling (ASI-G) module, which also assesses days and dollars wagered. Findings: Compared to the assessment-only condition, those receiving any intervention had significant decreases in ASI-G scores and days and dollars wagered over time. The MET condition decreased significantly ASI-G scores and dollars wagered over time, and increased the odds of a clinically significant reduction in gambling at the 9-month follow-up relative to the assessment-only condition, even after controlling for baseline indices that could impact outcomes. The Brief Advice and MET+CBT conditions had benefits on some, but not all, indices of gambling. None of the interventions differed significantly from one another.

Treatment showed superiority in some areas over the no-treatment control in the short term, including the primary outcome measure. No differences were found between MI and CBGT at any point in time. Instead, both MI and CBGT produced significant within-group decreases on most outcome measures up to the 12-month follow-up.

However, there are very few clinical outcome studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of clinical interventions for helping Chinese gamblers. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) has been found to be effective for helping problem gamblers to significantly reduce their gambling problems in western countries. Very few CBT clinical trials have been conducted with the Chinese populations, and the results were masked by methodological limitations. This preliminary study attempted to test the effectiveness of an integrated and culturally attuned CBT group treatment for Chinese problem gamblers in Hong Kong. This study adopted a randomized control design and 38 participants were allocated randomly to the experimental condition (n = 18) and control condition (n = 20). The experimental group received 10 weekly CBT group sessions and individual counseling services while control group only received the individual counseling services. Significant decreases in gambling severity and frequencies of gambling were found in the experimental group. The findings also showed that a change in gambling cognitions predicted the changes in gambling severity and gambling urge while a change in gambling severity was also linked to a change in depression. Preliminary evidence highlights the potential benefits of an integrated and culturally attuned CBT group treatment for Chinese problem gamblers in Hong Kong. However, a more vigorous research design with a larger sample is needed to provide solid evidence of the effectiveness of the model for Chinese problem gamblers.","A Preliminary Study of an Integrated and Culturally Attuned Cognitive Behavioral Group Treatment for Chinese Problem Gamblers in Hong Kong","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-014-9457-2","Journal of Gambling Studies","Wong, 2015","A - Western"

This study investigated three brief telephone interventions to determine whether they were more effective than standard helpline treatment in helping people to reduce gambling. Design: Randomized clinical trial. Setting: National gambling helpline in New Zealand. Participants: A total of 462 adults with problem gambling. INTERVENTIONS AND COMPARATOR: (1) Single motivational interview (MI), (2) single motivational interview plus cognitive-behavioural self-help workbook (MI + W) and (3) single motivational interview plus workbook plus four booster follow-up telephone interviews (MI + W + B). Comparator was helpline standard care [treatment as usual (TAU)]. Blinded follow-up was at 3, 6 and 12 months. Measurements: Primary outcomes were days gambled, dollars lost per day and treatment goal success. Findings: There were no differences across treatment arms, although participants showed large reductions in gambling during the 12-month follow-up period [mean reduction of 5.5 days, confidence interval (CI) = 4.8, 6.2; NZ$38 lost ($32, $44; 80.6%), improved (77.2%, 84.0%)].

I-CBT participants also rated the program as significantly more satisfactory. Treatment gains observed for both active conditions were found to be stable through to 12 month follow up.

This pilot randomized controlled trial sought to evaluate whether an online intervention for problem gambling could lead to improved gambling outcomes compared to a no intervention control. Participants were recruited through a crowdsourcing platform.  Methods
Participants were recruited to complete an online survey about their gambling through the Mechanical Turk platform. Those who scored 5 or more on the Problem Gambling Severity Index and were thinking about quitting or reducing their gambling were invited to complete 6-week and 6-month follow-ups. Each potential participant who agreed was sent a unique password. Participants who used their password to log onto the study portal were randomized to either access an online intervention for gambling or to a no intervention control. Results
A total of 321 participants were recruited, of which 87% and 88% were followed-up at 6 weeks and 6 months, respectively. Outcome analyses revealed that, while there were reductions in gambling from baseline to follow-ups, there was no significant observable impact of the online gambling intervention, as compared to a no intervention control condition. Conclusions
While the current trial observed no impact of the intervention, replication is merited with a larger sample size, and with participants who are not recruited through a crowdsourcing platform.","Pilot randomized controlled trial of an online intervention for problem gamblers","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352853219300252","Addictive Behaviors Reports","Cunningham, 2019","A - Western"

Because of easy access and convenience, along with other gaming characteristics, many researchers in the field have advanced the argument that Internet gambling is potentially more addictive and problematic than land-based gambling activities. However, research examining the efficacy of treatments for problem gamblers who gamble over the Internet has not yet been conducted. The purpose of the present study was to examine the efficacy of group cognitive behavioural therapy for self-identified problem Internet gamblers. (n = 16) or wait list (delayed treatment) comparison group (n = 16). Results indicated that the treatment was efficacious in improving three of the four dependent variables from pre- to post-test/treatment: number of DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling endorsed, perception of control over gambling, and number of sessions gambled. No significant pre- to post-test/treatment difference was found between groups on desire to gamble. Groups were combined to examine treatment outcome over time, with results showing significant pre- to post-treatment and pre- to three-month post-treatment improvement for all four dependent variables.","Cognitive behavioural group therapy for problem gamblers who gamble over the internet: A controlled study","https://cdspress.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nicholas-Harris-Dwight-Mazmanian.pdf","Journal of Gambling Issues","Harris, 2016","A - Western"

Cognitive correction techniques were used first to target gamblers' erroneous perceptions about randomness and then to address issues of relapse prevention. The dependent measures used were the South Oaks Gambling Screen, the number of DSM-IV criteria for pathological gambling met by participants, as well as gamblers' perception of control, frequency of gambling, perceived self-efficacy, and desire to gamble. Posttest results indicated highly significant changes in the treatment group on all outcome measures, and analysis of data from 6- and 12-month follow-ups revealed maintenance of therapeutic gains.

This study sought to examine the efficacy of brief intervention strategies. Design: Randomized trial. Setting: College campuses. Participants: A total of 117 college student problem and pathological gamblers. Interventions: Students were assigned randomly to: an assessment-only control, 10 minutes of brief advice, one session of motivational enhancement therapy (MET) or one session of MET, plus three sessions of cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). The three interventions were designed to reduce gambling. Measurements: Gambling was assessed at baseline, week 6 and month 9 using the Addiction Severity Index-gambling (ASI-G) module, which also assesses days and dollars wagered. Findings: Compared to the assessment-only condition, those receiving any intervention had significant decreases in ASI-G scores and days and dollars wagered over time. The MET condition decreased significantly ASI-G scores and dollars wagered over time, and increased the odds of a clinically significant reduction in gambling at the 9-month follow-up relative to the assessment-only condition, even after controlling for baseline indices that could impact outcomes. The Brief Advice and MET+CBT conditions had benefits on some, but not all, indices of gambling. None of the interventions differed significantly from one another. Conclusions These results suggest the efficacy of brief interventions for reducing gambling problems in college students.","Brief motivational interventions for college student problem gamblers","https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1360-0443.2009.02652.x","Addiction","Petry, 2009","A - Western"

Method: Substance abuse treatment patients with gambling problems (N = 217) were randomly assigned to a 10- to 15-min brief psychoeducation gambling intervention; a 10- to 15-min brief advice intervention addressing gambling norms, risk factors, and methods to prevent additional problems; or 4 50-min sessions of motivational enhancement therapy plus cognitive behavior therapy for reducing gambling (MET + CBT). Gambling and related problems were assessed at baseline and throughout 24 months. Results: In the sample as a whole, days and dollars wagered and gambling problems decreased markedly from baseline through Month 5; thereafter, reductions in dollars wagered and gambling problems continued to decrease modestly but significantly, and days gambled remained constant. Brief advice significantly reduced days gambled between baseline and Month 5 relative to brief psychoeducation. The MET + CBT condition engendered no benefit beyond brief advice in terms of days gambled but did lead to more precipitous reductions in dollars gambled and problems experienced in the initial 5 months, and greater clinically significant improvements in gambling in both the short and long term. MET + CBT also resulted in initial decreases in self-reported alcohol use and problems but did not differentially impact self-reported illicit drug use or submission of positive samples. Conclusions: Gambling problems tend to dissipate over time regardless of the intervention applied, but offering MET + CBT was more efficacious in decreasing gambling than providing a brief single session intervention.","A randomized controlled trial of brief interventions for problem gambling in substance abuse treatment patients.","https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-33917-001","Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology","Petry, 2016","A - Western"

Significant decreases in gambling severity and frequencies of gambling were found in the experimental group. The findings also showed that a change in gambling cognitions predicted the changes in gambling severity and gambling urge while a change in gambling severity was also linked to a change in depression. Preliminary evidence highlights the potential benefits of an integrated and culturally attuned CBT group treatment for Chinese problem gamblers in Hong Kong.

Participants in the active conditions (I-CBT and I-MFS) completed six online modules. Both I-CBT and I-MFS conditions resulted in significant treatment gains on gambling severity. However, I-CBT was also associated with reductions in a range of other gambling-related and mental health outcomes. Compared with I-MFS, I-CBT produced greater effects across seven outcomes measures, relating to gambling urges, cognitions, stress, and life satisfaction. I-CBT participants also rated the program as significantly more satisfactory. Treatment gains observed for both active conditions were found to be stable through to 12 month follow up. The results indicate that the benefits of I-CBT were more than simply the non-specific effects of engaging in online treatment or receiving motivation, feedback, and support.

This pilot randomized controlled trial sought to evaluate whether an online intervention for problem gambling could lead to improved gambling outcomes compared to a no intervention control. Participants were recruited through a crowdsourcing platform.  Methods
Participants were recruited to complete an online survey about their gambling through the Mechanical Turk platform. Those who scored 5 or more on the Problem Gambling Severity Index and were thinking about quitting or reducing their gambling were invited to complete 6-week and 6-month follow-ups. Each potential participant who agreed was sent a unique password. Participants who used their password to log onto the study portal were randomized to either access an online intervention for gambling or to a no intervention control. Results
A total of 321 participants were recruited, of which 87% and 88% were followed-up at 6 weeks and 6 months, respectively. Outcome analyses revealed that, while there were reductions in gambling from baseline to follow-ups, there was no significant observable impact of the online gambling intervention, as compared to a no intervention control condition. Conclusions
While the current trial observed no impact of the intervention, replication is merited with a larger sample size, and with participants who are not recruited through a crowdsourcing platform.","Pilot randomized controlled trial of an online intervention for problem gamblers","https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352853219300252","Addictive Behaviors Reports","Cunningham, 2019","A - Western"

This study examined the effectiveness of group cognitive-behavioural therapy (GCBT) on pathological gambling among Nigerian students. The study used a group randomised controlled trial design to assign participants to intervention and control groups. A total of 40 undergraduate students, aged 18–30, were classified as pathological gamblers (participants) in this study. Participants completed self-report scales titled South oaks gambling screen and Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale at three-time points. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. The data collected were statistically analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results revealed that GCBT has a significant effect in decreasing the symptoms of pathological gambling among the participants in GCBT compared to those in the control group and that the improvements were maintained at follow-up. The study concluded that group cognitive-behavioural therapy is impactful therapy in reducing pathological gambling among students. It has also validated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy in altering erroneous thoughts and replacing it with a better alternative realistic way of thinking.","Assessment of the Effectiveness of Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in Reducing Pathological Gambling","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09981-y","Journal of Gambling Studies","Ede, 2020","B - Non-Western"

The current study therefore assesses the efficacy of a French language self-help treatment including three motivational telephone interviews spread over an 11-week period and a cognitive-behavioral self-help workbook. At-risk and pathological gamblers were randomly assigned to the treatment group (n = 31) or the waiting list (n = 31). Relative to the waiting list, the treatment group showed a statistically significant reduction in the number of DSM-5 gambling disorder criteria met, gambling habits, and gambling consequences at Week 11. Perceived self-efficacy and life satisfaction also significantly improved after 11 weeks for the treatment group, but not for the waiting list group. At Week 11, 13% of participants had dropped out of the study. All significant changes reported for the treatment group were maintained throughout 1, 6 and 12-month follow-ups. Results support the efficacy of the self-help treatment to reduce problem gambling severity, gambling behaviour and to improve overall functioning among a sample of French Canadian problem gamblers over short, medium and long term. Findings from this study lend support to the appropriateness of self-help treatments for problem gamblers and help clarify inconsistencies found in the literature. The low dropout rate is discussed with respect to the advantages of the self-help format. Clinical and methodological implications of the results are put forth.","Efficacy of a Self-Help Treatment for At-Risk and Pathological Gamblers","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-017-9717-z","Journal of Gambling Studies","Boudreault, 2018","A - Western"

There are effective treatments, but little is known about the relative effectiveness of different treatments. The aim of this study was to test the effectiveness of motivational interviewing, cognitive behavioral group therapy, and a no-treatment control (wait-list) in the treatment of pathological gambling. This was done in a randomized controlled trial at an outpatient dependency clinic at Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden). A total of 150 primarily self-recruited patients with current gambling problems or pathological gambling according to an NORC DSM-IV screen for gambling problems were randomized to four individual sessions of motivational interviewing (MI), eight sessions of cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT), or a no-treatment wait-list control. Gambling-related measures derived from timeline follow-back as well as general levels of anxiety and depression were administered at baseline, termination, and 6 and 12 months posttermination. Treatment showed superiority in some areas over the no-treatment control in the short term, including the primary outcome measure. No differences were found between MI and CBGT at any point in time. Instead, both MI and CBGT produced significant within-group decreases on most outcome measures up to the 12-month follow-up. Both forms of intervention are promising treatments, but there is room for improvement in terms of both outcome and compliance.","Motivational Interviewing Versus Cognitive Behavioral Group Therapy in the Treatment of Problem and Pathological Gambling: A Randomized Controlled Trial","https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/16506070903190245","Cognitive Behaviour Therapy ","Carlbring, 2010","A - Western"

Participants in the active conditions (I-CBT and I-MFS) completed six online modules. Both I-CBT and I-MFS conditions resulted in significant treatment gains on gambling severity. However, I-CBT was also associated with reductions in a range of other gambling-related and mental health outcomes. Compared with I-MFS, I-CBT produced greater effects across seven outcomes measures, relating to gambling urges, cognitions, stress, and life satisfaction. I-CBT participants also rated the program as significantly more satisfactory. Treatment gains observed for both active conditions were found to be stable through to 12 month follow up. The results indicate that the benefits of I-CBT were more than simply the non-specific effects of engaging in online treatment or receiving motivation, feedback, and support. Online treatments for gambling may be a valuable tool in increasing help-seeking and treatment engagement in this population, and be integrated as part of stepped care approaches to treatment.","Internet-Based Delivery of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy Compared to Monitoring, Feedback and Support for Problem Gambling: A Randomised Controlled Trial","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-016-9666-y","Journal of Gambling Studies","Casey, 2017","A - Western"

The present study was a randomised, quadruple-blind, controlled trial. We set pre-to-post change in the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) as the primary outcome and pre-to-post change in the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (G-SAS) as a secondary outcome. Daily monitoring, personalised feedback, and private messages based on cognitive behavioural theory were offered to participants in the intervention group through a messaging app for 28 days (GAMBOT). Participants in the control group received biweekly messages only for assessments for 28 days (assessments only). A total of 197 problem gamblers were included in the primary analysis. We failed to demonstrate a significant between-group difference in the primary outcome (PGSI − 1.14, 95% CI − 2.75 to 0.47, p = 0.162) but in the secondary outcome (G-SAS − 3.14, 95% CI − 0.24 to − 6.04, p = 0.03). Only 6.7% of the participants dropped out during follow-up and 77% of the GAMBOT group participants (74/96) continued to participate in the intervention throughout the 28-day period.

This was done in a randomized controlled trial at an outpatient dependency clinic at Karolinska Institute (Stockholm, Sweden). A total of 150 primarily self-recruited patients with current gambling problems or pathological gambling according to an NORC DSM-IV screen for gambling problems were randomized to four individual sessions of motivational interviewing (MI), eight sessions of cognitive behavioral group therapy (CBGT), or a no-treatment wait-list control. Gambling-related measures derived from timeline follow-back as well as general levels of anxiety and depression were administered at baseline, termination, and 6 and 12 months posttermination. Treatment showed superiority in some areas over the no-treatment control in the short term, including the primary outcome measure. No differences were found between MI and CBGT at any point in time. Instead, both MI and CBGT produced significant within-group decreases on most outcome measures up to the 12-month follow-up.

Participants in the active conditions (I-CBT and I-MFS) completed six online modules. Both I-CBT and I-MFS conditions resulted in significant treatment gains on gambling severity. However, I-CBT was also associated with reductions in a range of other gambling-related and mental health outcomes. Compared with I-MFS, I-CBT produced greater effects across seven outcomes measures, relating to gambling urges, cognitions, stress, and life satisfaction. I-CBT participants also rated the program as significantly more satisfactory. Treatment gains observed for both active conditions were found to be stable through to 12 month follow up. The results indicate that the benefits of I-CBT were more than simply the non-specific effects of engaging in online treatment or receiving motivation, feedback, and support.

Participants completed self-report scales titled South oaks gambling screen and Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale at three-time points. The intervention lasted for 8 weeks. The data collected were statistically analysed using repeated-measures ANOVA. Results revealed that GCBT has a significant effect in decreasing the symptoms of pathological gambling among the participants in GCBT compared to those in the control group and that the improvements were maintained at follow-up. The study concluded that group cognitive-behavioural therapy is impactful therapy in reducing pathological gambling among students. It has also validated the effectiveness of cognitive-behavioural therapy in altering erroneous thoughts and replacing it with a better alternative realistic way of thinking.","Assessment of the Effectiveness of Group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy in Reducing Pathological Gambling","https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10899-020-09981-y","Journal of Gambling Studies","Ede, 2020","B - Non-Western"

Method: Substance abuse treatment patients with gambling problems (N = 217) were randomly assigned to a 10- to 15-min brief psychoeducation gambling intervention; a 10- to 15-min brief advice intervention addressing gambling norms, risk factors, and methods to prevent additional problems; or 4 50-min sessions of motivational enhancement therapy plus cognitive behavior therapy for reducing gambling (MET + CBT). Gambling and related problems were assessed at baseline and throughout 24 months. Results: In the sample as a whole, days and dollars wagered and gambling problems decreased markedly from baseline through Month 5; thereafter, reductions in dollars wagered and gambling problems continued to decrease modestly but significantly, and days gambled remained constant. Brief advice significantly reduced days gambled between baseline and Month 5 relative to brief psychoeducation. The MET + CBT condition engendered no benefit beyond brief advice in terms of days gambled but did lead to more precipitous reductions in dollars gambled and problems experienced in the initial 5 months, and greater clinically significant improvements in gambling in both the short and long term. MET + CBT also resulted in initial decreases in self-reported alcohol use and problems but did not differentially impact self-reported illicit drug use or submission of positive samples. Conclusions: Gambling problems tend to dissipate over time regardless of the intervention applied, but offering MET + CBT was more efficacious in decreasing gambling than providing a brief single session intervention.","A randomized controlled trial of brief interventions for problem gambling in substance abuse treatment patients.","https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-33917-001","Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology","Petry, 2016","A - Western"
